## History

The Egyptian priest Manetho grouped the pharaohs into 31 dynasties. Modern Egyptologists tend to count the early, Macedonian, and Ptolemaic pharaohs as three additional dynasties, for a total of 34 dynasties.  The dynasties are grouped into the following periods (all dates are BCE and approximate):

1. Predynastic (5000--3000), Dynasty 0
2. Early Dynastic (3000--2625), Dynasties 1--3
3. Old Kingdom (2625--2130), Dynasties 4--8
4. First Intermediate Period (2130--1980), Dynasties 9--11
5. Middle Kingdom (1980--1630), Dynasties 12--14
6. Second Intermediate Period (1630--1539), Dynasties 15--17
7. New Kingdom (1539--1075), Dynasties 18--20
8. Third Intermediate Period (1075--656), Dynasties 21--25
9. Late Period (664--332), Dynasties 26--31
10. Hellenistic Period (332--30), Dynasties 32--33

## Wisdom Literature

Here are a few excerpts from the Toby Wilkinson translation of the *Teaching of Ptahhotep,* generally believed to have been composed in the first half of the Twelth Dynasty (c. 1850):

> If you come across a disputatious man in the heat of the moment,
> who has authority over you as a superior,
> bend your arms in respect and bow.
> For if you vex him, he will not be friendly to you.
> Diminish his bad speech
> by not opposing him while he is in the heat of the moment.
> He will be called an ignoramus
> while your self-control will equal his wealth.
>
> If you come across a disputatious man
> who is your equal, your match,
> you will make your esteem greater than his by keeping silent.
> While he is saying bad things,
> there will be much discussion by the judges
> and your name will be good in the opinion of the elders.
>
> If you come across a disputatious man
> who is a poor man, not your equal,
> do not be aggressive to him simply because he is weak.
> Leave him alone and he will confute himself.
> Do not answer him back merely to lighten your heart
> Do not vent your anger against your opponent,
> for wretched is he who injures a poor man.
> What you wish will be done anyway:
> you will beat him through the elders' disapproval.
>
> If you are a man in a position of trust,
> sent by one elder to another,
> stick to the matter for which he sent you;
> give him the message exactly as he told you.
> Beware of slanderous speech
> which embroils one elder with another.
> Do not shun the truth, do not go beyond it;
> but an outburst should not be repeated.
> Do not speak against anyone
> great or small: it is bad for the spirit.
>
> If you are a leader
> whose authority is unhindered,
> you should achieve many things.
> Be mindful of tomorrow:
> a dispute does not come in the midst of praises
> but when the crocodile charges in, hatred arises.
>
> If you are a leader,
> listen quietly to the plea of a petitioner.
> Do not rebuff him from what he planned to say:
> a victim loves to vent his anger
> more than to achieve what he came for.
> As for someone who rebuffs a petition,
> it is said, 'Why does he reject it?'
> Not all that is petitioned for comes about,
> but a good hearing soothes the heart.
>
> If you are a man of virtue
> who sits in his master's hall,
> turn your mind to virtuous things.
> Your silence will be more effective than idle chatter.
> Speak only when you have thought of a solution,
> for it is only the skilled who should speak in the council.
> Speaking is more difficult than all other tasks
> he who does it fluently makes it his servant.
>
> If you are powerful, gain respect
> through knowledge and pleasant speech.
> Do not command unless it befits:
> hostility gets you into trouble.
> Do not be arrogant lest you be humiliated,
> do not be silent lest you be rebuked.
> When you reply to the speech of a hothead,
> avert your face and control yourself.
> The ire of the hothead sweeps by:
> he who treads carefully, his path is clear.
> He who is troubled all day long
> has no happy time,
> while he who is frivolous all day long
> cannot establish a household;
> but he who aims to complete a task
> is like someone who steers a matter safely to land,
> and another matter is held fast.
> He who listens to his heart will regret.
>
> Punish with authority, teach thoroughly,
> then suppression of wrongdoing remains a good deed.
> Punishment that is not deserved
> turns a complainant into an opponent.
