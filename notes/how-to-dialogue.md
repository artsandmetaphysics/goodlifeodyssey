  A formalized method of seeking the truth in conversation, inspired by Plato's dialogues.

Here is a method for two conversing truth-seekers to answer some question:

1. Agree on the main question.
2. Select the first questioner.
3. The questioner asks a question.
4. The responder succinctly responds _or_ requests to become the questioner.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until there is an impasse or the main question is answered.
