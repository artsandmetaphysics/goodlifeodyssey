  Notes on Dante's _Divine Comedy_
---

## Introduction

The *Divine Comedy* is Dante's great epic poem.

## Similes

The first simile in the _Comedy_ made me think of Odysseus' landing on Phaecia, or how I feel after running a marathon:

>   At this my fear was somewhat quieted;
> for through the night of sorrow I had spent,
> the lake within my heart felt terror present.
>   And just as he who, with exhausted breath,
> having escaped from sea to shore, turns back
> to watch the dangerous waters he has quit,
>   so did my spirit, still a fugitive,
> turn back to look intently at the pass
> that never has let any man survive.
> ~ (I.19--28)

The furies and demons who block Dante and Virgil's way into Dis, are scattered by an angel who effortlessly waves a wand and opens the door. The fleeing demons are compared to frogs and the angel is, ironically, implicitly the snake:

>   As frogs confronted by their enemy,
> the snake, will scatter underwater till
> each hunches in a heap along the bottom,
>   so did the thousand ruined souls I saw
> take flight before a figure crossing Styx
> who walked as if on land and with dry soles.
> ~ (IX.76--81)

There are several similes comparing the geography of hell to the geography of Italy. E.g., IX.112--117.

## The Pagan Gods

Dante combines Christianity with paganism in interesting ways.

Virgil comments about the gods' state of bliss, when describing Fortune:

>   "She is the one so frequently maligned
> even by those who should give praise to her---
> they blame her wrongfully with words of scorn.
>   But she is blessed and does not hear these things;
> for with the other primal beings, happy,
> she turns her sphere and glories in her bliss."
> ~ (VI.91--96)

## Dante's Ordered Universe

Dante placed Satan and Judas at the center of the earth, since he had a geocentric view of the universe. Thus, the center of the earth was as far as one could get from the heavens where God was. Virgil reassures Dante, while they wait at the Gate of Dis, that he's been down this path before:

>   My flesh had not been long stripped off when she
> had me descend through all the rings of Hell,
> to draw a spirit back from Judas' circle.
>   That is the deepest and darkest place,
> the farthest from the heaven that girds all:
> so rest assured, I know the pathway well.
> ~ (IX.25--30)

Dante mostly presents the order of his universe with small comments, but in Canto XI Virgil is more explicit:

>   Of every malice that earns hate in Heaven,
> injustice is the end; and each such end
> by force or fraud brings harm to other men.
>   However, fraud is man's peculiar vice;
> God finds it more displeasing---and therefore,
> the fraudulent are lower, suffering more.
> ~ (XI.23--27)

He then goes on to explain how the violent take a ring, but since one may violent against others, against self, and against God, that circle is divided in three. One may wonder how it's possible to be violent against an omnipotent God? Blasphemers, those that deny God's good, and those that passionately condemn God go here. Interestingly, sodomites go in this circle. The fraudulent are divided into those that are fraudulent against the untrusting and trusting. The upper hell, outside the city of Dis, includes only sins of incontinence---sins which don't involve injustice to others, but only the inability to control ones appetites. The lower hell involves sins that cause injustice to others. Thus, Dante doesn't divide hell according to the deadly sins but according to Aristotle's _Ethics_, which he explicitly references here. Note that the sixth circle filled with the heretics, doesn't quite fit in the three-fold classification.

Incontinence is about letting the appetites rule reason:

>   I learned that those who undergo this torment
> are damned because they sinned within the flesh,
> subjecting reason to the rule of lust.
> ~ (V.37--39)

>   And he to me: "All these, to left and right
> were squint-eyed of mind in the first life---
> no spending that they did was done with measure."
> ~ (VII.40--42)

## Islam

The wall of the city of Dis, which separates the incontinent from the violent and fraudulent, has mosques---Islamic styled towers:

>   I said: "I can already see distinctly---
> master---the mosques that gleam within the valley,
> as crimson as they had just been drawn
>   out of the fire." He told me: "The eternal
> flame burning there appears to make them red,
> as you can see, within this lower Hell."
> ~ (VIII.70--75)

## The Last Judgement

Dante the pilgrim asks why the lids of the heretics' tombs are open, and Virgil says they'll eventually be closed:

> And he to me: "They'll all be shuttered up
> when they return here from Jehosaphat
> together with the flesh they left above."
> ~ (X.10--12)

## Questions

How does the gluttons punishment, being stuck in filthy rain, fit their crime?

In several passages it's made clear that Dante the pilgrim still has a physical body. Yet many punishments are physical in nature. How is this consistent?

Why didn't the angel who came to help Virgil and Dante get into Dis speak to them?

Why are the Epicureans, in particular, placed in the sixth circle with the Heretics when other Pagan philosophers are in the first circle?

## Comments about Time

VI.97--99, XXIX.7--12

Also compare with the Aeneid, VI.623--632 (Fagles' line numbers).

XI.112--115
