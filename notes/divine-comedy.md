  Notes on Dante's _Divine Comedy_

## Introduction

The *Divine Comedy* is Dante's great epic poem.

## Poetic Summary



## Similes

The first simile in the _Comedy_ made me think of Odysseus' landing on Phaecia, or how I feel after running a marathon:

>   At this my fear was somewhat quieted;
> for through the night of sorrow I had spent,
> the lake within my heart felt terror present.
>   And just as he who, with exhausted breath,
> having escaped from sea to shore, turns back
> to watch the dangerous waters he has quit,
>   so did my spirit, still a fugitive,
> turn back to look intently at the pass
> that never has let any man survive.
> ~ (I.19--28)

## The Pagan Gods

Dante combines Christianity with paganism in interesting ways.

Virgil comments about the gods' state of bliss, when describing Fortune:

>   "She is the one so frequently maligned
> even by those who should give praise to her---
> they blame her wrongfully with words of scorn.
>   But she is blessed and does not hear these things;
> for with the other primal beings, happy,
> she turns her sphere and glories in her bliss."
> ~ (VI.91--96)

## Submitting to Reason

>   I learned that those who undergo this torment
> are damned because they sinned within the flesh,
> subjecting reason to the rule of lust.
> ~ (V.37--39)

>   And he to me: "All these, to left and right
> were squint-eyed of mind in the first life---
> no spending that they did was done with measure."
> ~ (VII.40--42)

## Questions

How does the gluttons punishment, being stuck in filthy rain, fit their crime?
