# Good Life Odyssey

## Design Goals

- Minimal styling so that myself (and other readers) can focus on the content
- Optimize reading the documents:
  - on a laptop
  - on a phone
  - printed copy of the document
- Allow me to write in a version of markdown that is tailored for my needs

## Building

Run `make` to compile static assets.

Start a test server using `run`.

## Typographical Substitutions

- `---` is replaced with an "em dash"
- `--` is replaced with an "en dash"
- `...` at the start of a line is replaced with "centered triple dots"
- Straight quotes are replaced with curly quotes everywhere
- Lines that start with a single word, followed by two colons (e.g., "Don::") will have have the word styled in small caps; this is useful for dialogues

## Citations

The final line of a quote indicates whether it is poetry and may contain a citation:

- Quote with citation: `- This is a non-poetry quote`
- Poetry with citation: `~ This is poetry`
- Poetry without a citation `~`
- Prose with citation: `= This is prose`
- Prose without a citation `=`

Inline citations must start with an open parenthesis.

## References

References are in pseudo form of the Oxford Style.  I prune some stuff that isn't necessary (e.g. who cares about the publisher these days, lots of books are self-published).  See [this site](http://guides.library.uwa.edu.au/c.php?g=325241&p=2177430) for examples.

## Titles

Book names which are present in the titles of document are surrounded by quotes, instead of italics.  This is due to how browsers and search engines treat the `<title>` tag and meta data.

## Style

- Write predominantly in the present tense
- Use mostly first-person
- My usual mood is earnest and optimistic

## Open Issues

- Test RSS feed
- Make the sitemap more sophisticated

## Known Issues

- Quoted poetry has extra new lines in Safari "Reader Mode."
- Dialogue is not formatted properly.

## How to Pick a Topic

I don't finish a lot of the pieces I begin because I have limited time to write and my topics are too ambitious, thus I loose interest before I have time to finish them.

To fight this, I need to pick smaller topics and write more meditations.
