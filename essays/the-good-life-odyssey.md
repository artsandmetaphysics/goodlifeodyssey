  The Good Life Odyssey

We are on a long journey to find and live the _good life_. For most of us, our destination is behind a haze, and we must navigate while traveling.

This haze is a set of questions: How should we spend our time? Is there a divine will for our lives and, if so, what is it? How do we balance our wants with others?

My first destination was provided by my Christian upbringing. Ultimately, I decided that

I want to live a _good life_. This is too broad to be useful, so it must be subdivided.

Since I don't know what a good life is, the first sub goal is to determine what the good life is.

I also don't know how to do this, but I have some ideas, and so will search as best I can while improving my approach as I go.

Many people decide how to act based on their religions. So the first question is to decide which religion is true. This in turn is difficult, but I have developed a process for evaluating religions. According to this process, no religion I am aware of seems likely to be true. I have mostly moved on from this question, but the door is never closed, and I must be open to rethinking my process as well as revisiting the evidence used in the process.

Without religion, how does one determine learn how to live the good life?

Exploring, observing, and thinking about what you see. What is good? What within the world is valuable? Are people the only valuable thing? How important are animals? Are some people more important than others? If people are the most valuable thing, how does that affect our actions? How do you balance your own happiness with helping others?

We can make progress answering these question on our own, but other people have spent life times thinking about these questions, and it would be wise to learn from them. Some of these people are alive today, but they are hard to find and have other obligations. Thus, while I relish the opportunity to speak with living people about these matters, I most often turn to reading, listening to podcasts, and watching videos online.

Talking to others is helpful; it is easy to fool oneself, and finding intelligent people to discuss deep topics with helps dispel poor thinking. I have a few groups of friends who are interested in similar topics (we often read books together and discuss them). These discussions have changed my life. One of the reasons I have made this website is to try and find more people to talk to.

Conversation is very useful for dispelling poor thinking and implicit assumptions, but it has some weaknesses too. It is difficult to systematically tackle a subject in a conversation. Writing is better for this. Also, I think speaking is best for debating and considering thoughts and ideas you have already pondered somewhat. Reading and thinking by one self is best for coming up with new ideas. (Although often I learn new ideas that other people have thought of---and occasionally new ideas are stimulated from the conversation itself.)

I think reading, listening to podcasts, and watching videos are all great. Podcasts are nice when one is doing chores. Videos can help when a subject has a visual component to it. In general, I have found reading to be the most helpful for answering deep questions. In particular, I think reading older books---classics. This itself is an open question, and one that I continue to ponder.

It is easy to read a book without grasping its wisdom. I have forgotten the contents of many books. To help avoid this, I have found writing notes as I read, and asking questions of the author, helps me connect with the material at a deeper level. It in turn helps me make more progress understanding what the good life is.

I also write essays to distill my thoughts; I believe writing is thinking on paper. To write clearly, one must think clearly.

So I am spending a lot of time reading classical books, writing about them, and occasionally discussing them with others. What books? Surely not all of them are equally useful? For example, I read Herodotus' _Histories_, which discusses the war between the Persians and the Greeks. How likely is such a book to help me answer what the good life is?

It is starting to look like finding the good life is a long process---an odyssey in itself. To someone like myself, who enjoys reading and thinking, it seems like the process could itself become a selfish pursuit. I am focused on myself, doing things that I enjoy, without looking outward. To avoid this trap, one must not _only_ think about the good life, but live it!

What is the right balance between defining the good life and living it?

I am not sure. I think, as one gets older and has a better idea of what the good life is, a larger fraction is spent living it than thinking about it. But I don't think you ever stop living and thinking. The two are recursive---living can affect your thinking.
