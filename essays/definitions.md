## Types of Definitions

There are different types of definitions. One type describes how a word is typically used. The _New Oxford American Dictionary_ is filled with these. Since they describe the standard way a word is used, I will call them _standard definitions_. Another type, which I will call _formal definitions_, states what a word means in a particular context.

Philosophical treatises, technical standards, and legal contracts use formal definitions. For example, a legal contract may define a _person_ to be "a natural person, partnership, corporation, or any legal entity." Unlike the standard definition of _person_ in the dictionary, the contract is not claiming that _person_ is usually used this way; it only wants the reader to equate _person_ with its definition when reading the contract.

Formal definitions are used in other writing, but they tend to be less explicit than in legal contracts. A book author may state, near the end of chapter two, that racism is "when a racial group's prejudice is backed by legal authority and institutional control." A quote from this book read without the author's formal definition will be misunderstood because the reader will assume _racism_ is used in the standard way: "discrimination or antagonism directed against a person on the basis of their membership in a particular racial group."

This confusion would be avoided if, instead of redefining _racism_, the author formally defined a new word or used a longer, more precise phrase, such as _systemic racism_. Both alternatives have shortcomings. New words are hard to remember, and phrases get tiresome. The latter problem may be evident in my use of _formal definition_ and _standard definition_.

A standard definition is _wrong_ when it is not what people usually mean. What people _usually mean_ changes, which is why reason Shakespeare is hard to understand. It also varies geographically, which is why there are British dictionaries and American dictionaries. Despite these complexities, whether a standard definition is correct is an empirical question. People who compile dictionaries, lexicographers, compile massive databases to study how, and how often, words are used. They also track how word use changes, and update the dictionary definitions.

Formal definition, on the other hand, can't be _wrong_. They can only be _useless_. 

## Precise Definitions

Inconsiderate authors will use words in a non-standard way without giving a formal definition to their readers. And, since standard definitions changes over time, old books may not use words like you expect them to.

When two people converse, each assumes the other is using words like themself; if Yet frequently, neither person could define the words they are using.

It is difficult to define words.  recursive, and only as precise as they need to be for their common uses.

The contextual nature of words is best illustrated with examples: When a veterinarian asks whether a recently sedated dog is conscious, we know they are asking if the dog is a awake. When a contemplative person asks whether a dog is conscious, we know they are asking if the dog's mind is somehow like a human's mind. When a botanist is told by their friend to "turn right after the fourth tree," they know when to turn, despite the second and third plants being shrubs. Words can be used in several ways. We infer the appropriate use from context.

The more fundamental problem with definitions is that they are recursive. A dictionary contains these two definitions recursive definitions:

- consciousness: the fact of awareness by the mind of itself and the world
- self-aware: having conscious knowledge of one's own character and feelings.

If words are defined with other words, where does meaning come from?

I think that the meaning of abstract words like consciousness is built up from more concrete words in a huge web of definitions. 

At the lowest level, the meaning of words comes directly from association with our sensory inputs and motor outputs. Thus, meaning bubbles up from the concrete uses at the bottom, to their more abstract uses at the top.

The more abstract a word is---that is, the more separate from material reality a word is---the less likely a precise definition can be given for the word.

Recursive definitions are especially problematic during abstract philosophical discussions. I have had heated conversations resolve after someone defines their words and we realize we had been agreeing all along!

I think this is one of the reasons why many philosophical treatises begin by defining their terms. Philosophical definitions are different than the definitions we find in a dictionary. A formal definition is an intended equivalence between a word and other words.

## Circular Definitions and How We Learn

The recursive nature of language is also unavoidable. Legal documents and technical standards often include formal definitions, but they are written using words with standard definitions.

It would not be possible to provide formal definitions for all words used, since how could one provide the first formal definition before any other words were written? This unavoidable recursion ties back to how we learn language---by examples! Once we have learned the core of the language by examples as a child, we may learn new words by only definitions, but the foundation of the language is not formally defined.

Similarly, mathematical texts use words to provide meaning to their axiomatic symbols.

Words are like mathematical models used by engineers and scientists. The simplest model that accurately describes the portion of reality that is of interest is often the best. Analogously, we often use words in ways that are precise enough to accomplish the task we need them too. Everyday conversations tend to use simpler grammar and vocabulary because simpler tasks are being accomplished.

Words that are too broad or too narrow are not useful. When no common words provide detailed enough models for the area of interest, specialists develop lingo.

## Definitions and Politics

Words and their definitions do not exist in isolation; definitions can have ethical and political implications. When this is the case, people often will say a definition is _wrong_ even though it may be what people _usually mean_ by the word. For example, people say things like "we should change how we define beauty to be more inclusive." This statement is not saying the definition of beauty is wrong because it is, empirically, not what people usually mean by the word beauty. Rather, they are saying the word is wrong because it leads to unethical behavior.

What makes a better understanding of words useful?

- Avoid misunderstanding others
- Persuade others with your words

Shared definitions are only as precise as they need to be for how they are used
  Most tasks in everyday life don't require much precision
  Specialists (lawyers, scientists, etc.) often require more precision, hence lingo
  Many traditional philosophical problems appear to be caused when definitions are pushed too far
Words are recursively defined
  Concrete meaning stems from underlying reality

Does language dictate how we think, or does how we think dictate language? Are the categories defined by words as such because the categories exist in reality, or do we project the (arbitrary) categories in our words onto the world? Likely, dictation occurs in both directions in differing degrees for different words; more concrete words would seem to be more tied to reality, and our language thus more dictated by thought, while abstract ideas may be more dictated by our words.

For example, what is the distinction between a _philosophy_ and a _religion_? Since I considered stoicism to be a philosophy, it took me a while to notice and comprehend the religious components of Marcus Aurelius' work. If the categories in my head, of philosophy and religion, were different, my understanding of stoicism may not have taken so long to acquire.

Formal definitions tend to introduce central ideas in a new work, since they are used for new ideas, new ideas for which there are no existing words. The author could repeat the definition each time it is needed, but that would make the work hard to understand. Words are abstractions, like functions in a program. They let us "fit more in our head."
