When two people converse, each assumes the other is using words like themself. Yet frequently, neither person could define the words they are using.

It is difficult to define words.  recursive, and only as precise as they need to be for their common uses.

The contextual nature of words is best illustrated with examples: When a veterinarian asks whether a recently sedated dog is conscious, we know they are asking if the dog is a awake. When a contemplative person asks whether a dog is conscious, we know they are asking if the dog's mind is somehow like a human's mind. When a botanist is told by their friend to "turn right after the fourth tree," they know when to turn, despite the second and third plants being shrubs. Words can be used in several ways. We infer the appropriate use from context.

The more fundamental problem with definitions is that they are recursive. A dictionary contains these two definitions recursive definitions:

- consciousness: the fact of awareness by the mind of itself and the world
- self-aware: having conscious knowledge of one's own character and feelings.

If words are defined with other words, where does meaning come from?

I think that the meaning of abstract words like consciousness is built up from more concrete words in a huge web of definitions. 

At the lowest level, the meaning of words comes directly from association with our sensory inputs and motor outputs. Thus, meaning bubbles up from the concrete uses at the bottom, to their more abstract uses at the top.

The more abstract a word is---that is, the more separate from material reality a word is---the less likely a precise definition can be given for the word.

Recursive definitions are especially problematic during abstract philosophical discussions. I have had heated conversations resolve after someone defines their words and we realize we had been agreeing all along!

I think this is one of the reasons why many philosophical treatises begin by defining their terms. Philosophical definitions are different than the definitions we find in a dictionary. A formal definition is an intended equivalence between a word and other words.

There are two types of definitions. The first type describes what people usually mean by the word. The dictionary is filled with these. I will call them _standard definitions_. The second is a formal equivalence between a word and other words. These are found in legal contracts, philosophical treatises, and technical standards. They 

A standard definition is wrong when it is not what people usually mean. For example, the word _book_ does not mean _yellow fruit_. On the other hand, a formal definition can not be wrong---it can only be useless. We can formally define the word _book_ to mean _yellow fruit_ if we like, but it is not very useful. This distinction between standard definitions and formal definitions is often obscured because, to aid our memory, we often provide formal definitions for words that are very similar to that same word's standard definition.

What people _usually mean_ by a word varies in time and place. Since standard definitions change, it is clear some words will have multiple standard definitions
Despite these complexities, whether a standard definition is true is an empirical question. 

The recursive nature of language is also unavoidable. Legal documents and technical standards often include formal definitions, but they are written using words with standard definitions.

It would not be possible to provide formal definitions for all words used, since how could one provide the first formal definition before any other words were written? This unavoidable recursion ties back to how we learn language---by examples! Once we have learned the core of the language by examples as a child, we may learn new words by only definitions, but the foundation of the language is not formally defined.

Similarly, mathematical texts use words to provide meaning to their axiomatic symbols.

Words are like mathematical models used by engineers and scientists. The simplest model that accurately describes the portion of reality that is of interest is often the best. Analogously, we often use words in ways that are precise enough to accomplish the task we need them too. Everyday conversations tend to use simpler grammar and vocabulary because simpler tasks are being accomplished.

Words that are too broad or too narrow are not useful. When no common words provide detailed enough models for the area of interest, specialists develop lingo.

Words and their definitions do not exist in isolation; definitions can have ethical and political implications. When this is the case, people often will say a definition is _wrong_ even though it may be what people _usually mean_ by the word. For example, people say things like "we should change how we define beauty to be more inclusive." This statement is not saying the definition of beauty is wrong because it is, empirically, not what people usually mean by the word beauty. Rather, they are saying the word is wrong because it leads to unethical behavior.

What makes a better understanding of words useful?

- Avoid misunderstanding others
- Persuade others with your words

Shared definitions are only as precise as they need to be for how they are used
  Most tasks in everyday life don't require much precision
  Specialists (lawyers, scientists, etc.) often require more precision, hence lingo
  Many traditional philosophical problems appear to be caused when definitions are pushed too far
Words are recursively defined
  Concrete meaning stems from underlying reality
