If God _needed_ to send Jesus to be merciful and just when he condemns but forgives sinful humans, then God is bound by an external moral standard.

If God defines our moral standard he would not _need_ to send Jesus---he could have declared by the fact that he defines right and wrong, justice, and mercy that he both condemns sin and forgives us while also being merciful and just.

A natural response is to conclude that God didn't _need_ to send Jesus, but rather, he merely _wanted_ to.
