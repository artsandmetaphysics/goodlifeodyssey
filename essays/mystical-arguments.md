  A few thoughts about mystical arguments.  
---

One way Socrates changed people's minds was to show a person that two of their beliefs contradict. He would tease out these contradictions by asking a sequence of questions, and once the contradiction became apparent the other person would usually abandon or refine one of the beliefs. Anyone who has applied this method knows that it doesn't always change the other person's mind. One alternate ending, which is especially common when talking about religion, goes like this: "I know these two beliefs _seem_ contradictory, but our minds are limited. Thus, I won't change my mind." I call this type of response a _mystical argument_, since it claims there is a mystery that's beyond reason's ability to grasp.

When someone uses a mystical argument, Socrates makes fun of them and walks away. Mystics and rationalists don't usually get along, but the mystic might be right. Our minds _are_ limited. It seems unreasonable to think we can grasp all truths. The problem is mystical arguments can justify any beliefs, so how do we evaluate when to accept them?

Consider an example: Many people believe God knows everything and that people have free will. These two beliefs seem contradictory. If God knows someone will murder their father and marry their mother, then how could that person not murder their father and marry their mother? This paradox has been discussed since before Jesus was born. Some Christians argue that God experiences time differently than us and because of this he can know everything while we still have free will. This is a mystical argument, although it feels plausible.
