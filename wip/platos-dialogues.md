## Meno

## Gorgias

What is the use of rhetoric? The good is not the pleasant. Is it better to suffer injustice or to be injust?

## Pheadrus

What makes a good speech?

> First, you must know the truth concerning everything you are speaking or writing about; you must learn how to define each thing in itself; and, having defined it, you must know how to divide it into kinds until you reach something indivisible. Second, you must understand the nature of the soul, along the same lines; you must determine which kind of speech is appropriate to each kind of soul, prepare and arrange your speech accordingly, and offer a complex and elaborate speech to a complex soul and a simple speech to a simple one. Then, and only then, will you be able to use speech artfully, to the extent its nature allows it to be used in that way, either in order to teach or in order to persuade. This is the whole point of the argument we have been making.

Is love good for the lover or the beloved?

## Symposium

Set a few decades before it was written, _Symposium_ retells a circuit of speeches given at an aristocratic drinking party in praise of Eros. Phaedrus, in the first speech, praises love completely:

> If only there were a way to start a city or an army made up of lovers and the boys they love! Theirs would be the best possible system of society, for they would hold back from all that is shameful, and seek honor in each other's eyes. Even a few of them, in battle side by side, would conquer all the world, I'd say.

Pausanias, in the next speech, distinguishes heavenly love from vulgar love. The former is good, the latter is bad:

> Love is, like everything else, complex: considered simply in itself, it is neither honorable nor a disgrace---its character depends entirely on the behavior it gives rise to. To give oneself to a vile man in a vile way is truly disgraceful behavior; by contrast, it is perfectly honorable to give oneself honorably to the right man. Now you may want to know who counts as vile in this context. I'll tell you: it is the common, vulgar lover, who loves the body rather than the soul, the man whose love is bound to be inconstant, since what he loves is itself mutable and unstable. The moment the body is no longer in bloom, "he flies off and away," his promises and vows in tatters behind him. How different form this is a man who loves the right sort of character, and who remains its lover for life, attached as he is to something that is permanent.

The doctor, Eryximachus, considers love in the more general sense of attraction between dislike things. "Medicine is simply the science of the effects of Love on repletion and depletion of the body, and the hallmark of the accomplished physician is his ability to distinguish the Love that is noble from the Love that is ugly and disgraceful." So love is the basis of medicine, and he goes on to explain how it is the basis of other fields too: "Music is therefore simply the science of the effects of Love on rhythm and harmony... Divination, therefore, is the practice that produces loving affection between gods and men; it is simply the science of the effects of Love on justice and piety."

Aristophanes the comic playwright, describes how humans were split in two:

> Now, since their natural form had been cut in two, each longed for its own other half, and so they would throw their arms about each other weaving themselves together, wanting to grow together. In that condition they would die from hunger and general idleness, because they would not do anything apart from each other. Whenever one of the halves died and one was left, the one that was left still sought another and wove itself together with that. Sometimes the half he met came from a woman, as we'd call her now, sometimes it came from a man; either way, they kept on dying.
> Then, however, Zeus took pity on them, and came up with another plan: he moved their genitals around to the front! Before, you see, they used to have their genitals outside, like their faces, and they cast seed and made children, not in one another, but in the ground, like cicadas. So Zeus brought about this relocation of genitals, and in doing so he invented interior reproduction, _by_ the man _in_ the woman. The purpose of this was so that, when a man embraced a woman, he would cast his seed and they would have children; but when male embraced male, they would at least have the satisfaction of intercourse, after which they could stop embracing, return to their jobs, and look after their other needs in life. This, then, is the source of our desire to love each other. Love is born into every human being; it calls back the halves of our original nature together; it tries to make one out of two and heal the wound of human nature.

Next, Agathon, the host of the party and a young tragic playwright, gives his speech. He begins by rebuffing the earlier speeches: "Those who have spoken before me did not so much celebrate the god as congratulate human beings on the good things that come to them from the god. Now only one method is correct for every praise, no matter whose: you must explain what qualities in the subject of your speech enable him to give the benefits for which we praise him." He then gives reasons to think Love is beautiful, just, moderate, brave, and wise.
