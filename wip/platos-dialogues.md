## Euthyphro

What is piety?

## Apology

Socrates argues at court

Portrays Socrates as the new hero to replace Achilles

## Crito

What do we owe our polity?

## Phaedo

Socrates' death scene. Will the soul survive death?

The only play when Socrates laughs.

## Theaetetus

What is knowledge?

## Meno

Learning is remembering

## Gorgias

What is the use of rhetoric? The good is not the pleasant. Is it better to suffer injustice or to be unjust?

## Protagoras

Is virtue teachable? Is virtue a form of knowledge? How are courage, prudence, moderation, justice, and piety related?

Protagoras was the first professional Sophist---the first to charge money as a teacher. He was famous for the saying "man is the measure of all things." The dramatic setting contrasts his vague speeches with Socrates' precise dialectic.

## Euthydemus

Socrates asks two dumb sophists if they can convince a young man to love virtue. They make various silly arguments, which Socrates ironically refutes. Socrates argues that wisdom is the greatest good:

> With respect to all the things we called good in the beginning, the correct account is not that in themselves they are good by nature, but rather as follows: if ignorance controls them, they are greater evils than their opposites, to the extent that they are more capable of comply with a bad master; but if good sense and wisdom are in control, they are greater goods. In themselves, however, neither sort is of any value.... then let us consider what follows: since we all wish to be happy, and since we appear to become so by using things and using them rightly, and since knowledge was the source of rightness and good fortune, it seems to be necessary that every man should prepare himself by every means to become as wise as possible.

Socrates makes the point even more strongly later:

> Even if all the gold in the world should be ours with no trouble and without digging for it, we should be no better off---no, not even if we knew how to make stones into gold would the knowledge be worth anything. For unless we also knew how to use the gold, there appeared to be no value in it.
> Nor does there seem to be any value in any other sort of knowledge which knows how to make things, whether money making or medicine or any other such thing, unless it knows how to use what it makes.
> And again, if there exists the knowledge of how to make men immortal, but without the knowledge of how to use this immortality, there seems to be no value in it, if we are to conclude anything from what has already been settled.

This humbles the engineer in me.

## Pheadrus

What makes a good speech?

> First, you must know the truth concerning everything you are speaking or writing about; you must learn how to define each thing in itself; and, having defined it, you must know how to divide it into kinds until you reach something indivisible. Second, you must understand the nature of the soul, along the same lines; you must determine which kind of speech is appropriate to each kind of soul, prepare and arrange your speech accordingly, and offer a complex and elaborate speech to a complex soul and a simple speech to a simple one. Then, and only then, will you be able to use speech artfully, to the extent its nature allows it to be used in that way, either in order to teach or in order to persuade. This is the whole point of the argument we have been making.

How is the soul structured?

> To describe what the soul actually is would require a very long account, altogether a task for a god in every way; but to say what it is like is humanly possible and takes less time. So let us do the second in our speech. Let us then liken the soul to the natural union of a team of winged horses and their charioteer. The gods have horses and charioteers that are themselves all good and come from good stock besides, while everyone else has a mixture. To begin with, our driver is in charge of a pair of horses; second, one of his horses is beautiful and good and from stock of the same sort, while the other is the opposite and has the opposite sort of bloodline. This means that chariot-driving in our case is inevitably a painfully difficult business.

Is love good for the lover or the beloved?

## Symposium

Set a few decades before it was written, _Symposium_ retells a circuit of speeches given at an aristocratic drinking party in praise of Eros. Phaedrus, in the first speech, praises love completely:

> If only there were a way to start a city or an army made up of lovers and the boys they love! Theirs would be the best possible system of society, for they would hold back from all that is shameful, and seek honor in each other's eyes. Even a few of them, in battle side by side, would conquer all the world, I'd say.

Pausanias, in the next speech, distinguishes heavenly love from vulgar love. The former is good, the latter is bad:

> Love is, like everything else, complex: considered simply in itself, it is neither honorable nor a disgrace---its character depends entirely on the behavior it gives rise to. To give oneself to a vile man in a vile way is truly disgraceful behavior; by contrast, it is perfectly honorable to give oneself honorably to the right man. Now you may want to know who counts as vile in this context. I'll tell you: it is the common, vulgar lover, who loves the body rather than the soul, the man whose love is bound to be inconstant, since what he loves is itself mutable and unstable. The moment the body is no longer in bloom, "he flies off and away," his promises and vows in tatters behind him. How different form this is a man who loves the right sort of character, and who remains its lover for life, attached as he is to something that is permanent.

The doctor, Eryximachus, considers love in the more general sense of attraction between dislike things. "Medicine is simply the science of the effects of Love on repletion and depletion of the body, and the hallmark of the accomplished physician is his ability to distinguish the Love that is noble from the Love that is ugly and disgraceful." So love is the basis of medicine, and he goes on to explain how it is the basis of other fields too: "Music is therefore simply the science of the effects of Love on rhythm and harmony... Divination, therefore, is the practice that produces loving affection between gods and men; it is simply the science of the effects of Love on justice and piety."

Aristophanes the comic playwright, describes how humans were split in two:

> Now, since their natural form had been cut in two, each longed for its own other half, and so they would throw their arms about each other weaving themselves together, wanting to grow together. In that condition they would die from hunger and general idleness, because they would not do anything apart from each other. Whenever one of the halves died and one was left, the one that was left still sought another and wove itself together with that. Sometimes the half he met came from a woman, as we'd call her now, sometimes it came from a man; either way, they kept on dying.
> Then, however, Zeus took pity on them, and came up with another plan: he moved their genitals around to the front! Before, you see, they used to have their genitals outside, like their faces, and they cast seed and made children, not in one another, but in the ground, like cicadas. So Zeus brought about this relocation of genitals, and in doing so he invented interior reproduction, _by_ the man _in_ the woman. The purpose of this was so that, when a man embraced a woman, he would cast his seed and they would have children; but when male embraced male, they would at least have the satisfaction of intercourse, after which they could stop embracing, return to their jobs, and look after their other needs in life. This, then, is the source of our desire to love each other. Love is born into every human being; it calls back the halves of our original nature together; it tries to make one out of two and heal the wound of human nature.

Next, Agathon, the host of the party and a young tragic playwright, gives his speech. He begins by rebuffing the earlier speeches: "Those who have spoken before me did not so much celebrate the god as congratulate human beings on the good things that come to them from the god. Now only one method is correct for every praise, no matter whose: you must explain what qualities in the subject of your speech enable him to give the benefits for which we praise him." He then gives reasons to think Love is beautiful, just, moderate, brave, and wise.
