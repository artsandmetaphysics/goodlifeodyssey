## Oedipus the King

Angered Tiresias implicates Oedipus:

> So, you mock my blindness? Let me tell you this.
> You with your precious eyes,
> you're blind to the corruption of your life,
> to the house you live in, those you live with---
> who _are_ your parents? Do you know? All unknowing
> you are the scourge of your own flesh and blood,
> the dead below the earth and the living here above,
> and the double lash of your mother and your father's curse
> will whip you from this land one day, their footfall
> treading you down in terror, darkness shrouding
> your eyes that can see the light!

The following quotations expresses two ideas central to the Greek world view. First, that the gods strip down the over-proud man, the man filled with hubris. Second, that we competition is healthy.

> Destiny guide me always
> Destiny guide me filled with reverence
> pure in word and deed.
> Great laws tower above us, reared on high
> born for the brilliant vault of heaven---
> Olympian Sky their only father,
> nothing mortal, no man gave them birth,
> their memory deathless, never lost in sleep:
> within them lives a mighty god, the god does not
> grow old. Pride breeds the tyrant
> violent pride, gorging, crammed to bursting
> with all that is overripe and rich with ruin---
> clawing up to the heights, headlong pride
> crashes down the abyss---sheer doom!
> No footing helps, all foothold lost and gone.
> But the healthy strife that makes the city strong---
> I pray that god will never end that wrestling:
> god, my champion, I will never let you go.

These two ideas are present in many of the ancient Greek works; Hesiod, near the opening of _Works and Days_, speaks of strife that causes men to compete with one another, doing people good; Herodotus' stories highlight his belief that the gods tore down overproud men---he also explicitly discusses this idea; the _Iliad_ is filled with proud men striving with one other to "be the best."

The Chorus, after Oedipus is revealed:

> O the generations of men
> the dying generations---adding the total
> of all your lives I find they come to nothing...
> does there exist, is there a man on earth
> who seizes more joy than just a dream, a vision?
> And the vision no sooner dawns than dies
> blazing into oblivion.
> You are my great example, you, your life
> your destiny, Oedipus, man of misery---
> I count no man blest.

Oedipus, chases after his wife and mother Jocasta:

> His wife,
> no wife, his mother, where can eh find the mother earth
> that cropped two crops at once, himself and all his children?
> He was raging---one of the dark powers pointing the way,
> with a great shattering cry---someone, something leading him on---
> he hurled at the twin doors and bending the bolts back
> out of their sockets, crashed through the chamber.
> And there we saw the woman hanging by the neck,
> cradled high in a woven noose, spinning,
> swinging back and forth. And when he saw her,
> giving a low, wrenching sob that broke our hearts,
> slipped the halter from her throat, he eased her down,
> in a slow embrace he laid her down, poor thing...
> then, what came next, what horror we beheld!
> He rips off her brooches, the long gold pins
> holding her robes---and lifting them high,
> looking straight up into the points,
> he digs them down the sockets of his eyes, crying, "You,
> you'll see no more the pain I suffered, all the pain I caused!
> Too long you looked on the ones you never should have seen,
> blind to the ones you longed to see, to know! Blind
> from this hour on! Blind in the darkness---blind!"
> His voice like a dirge, rising, over and over
> raising the pins, raking them down his eyes.
> And at each stroke blood spurts from the roots,
> splashing his beard, a swirl of it, nerves and clots---
> black hail of blood pulsing, gushing down.

The Chorus, at the end of the play:

> People of Thebes, my countrymen, look on Oedipus.
> He solved the famous riddle with his brilliance,
> he rose to power, a man beyond all power.
> Who could behold his greatness without envy?
> Now what a black sea of terror has overwhelmed him.
> Now as we keep our watch and wait the final day,
> count no many happy till he dies, free of pain at last.

This metric for judging the happy life is in Herodotus' fable of Solon meeting Croesus.

## Oedipus at Colonus

> Oh Theseus,
> dear friend, only the gods can never age,
> the gods can never die. All else in the world
> almighty Time obliterates, crushes all
> to nothing. The earth's strength wastes away,
> the strength of a man's body wastes and dies---
> faith dies, and bad faith comes to life,
> and the same wind of friendship cannot blow forever,
> holding steady and strong between two friends,
> much less between two cities.
> For some of us soon, for others later,
> joy turns to hate and back again to love.
> And even if all is summer sunshine now
> between yourself and Thebes,
> infinite Time, sweeping through its rounds
> gives birth to infinte nights and days...
> and a day will come when the treaties of an hour,
> the pacts firmed by a handclasp will snap---
> at the slightest word a spear will hurl them to the winds---
> some far-off day when my dead body, slumbering, buried
> cold in death, will drain their hot blood down,
> if Zeus is still Zeus and Apollow the son of god
> speaks clear and true.
> ~ (685--707)

> Here, stranger,
> here in the land of horses are a glory
> you have reached the noblest home on earth
> Colonus glistening, brilliant in the sun---
> where the nightingale sings on,
> her dying music rising clear,
> hovering always, never leavning,
> down the shadows deepening green
> she haunts the glades, the wine-dark ivy,
> dense and dark the untrodden, sacred wood of god
> rich with laurel and olives never touched by the sun
> untouched by storms that blast from every quarter---
> where the Reveler Dionysus strides the earth forever
> where the wild nymphs are dancing round him
> nymphs who nursed his life.
> And here it blooms, fed by the dews of heaven
> lovely, clustering, morning-fresh forever,
> narcissus, crown of the Great Goddesss
> Mother and Daughter dying
> into life from the dawn of time,
> and the gold crocus bursts like break of day
> and the springs will never sleep, will never fail,
> the fountainhead of Cephisus flowing nomad
> quickening life forever, fresh each day---
> life rising up with the river's pure tide
> flowing over the plains, the swelling breats of earth---
> nor can the dancing Muses bear to leave this land
> or the Goddess Aphrodite, the charioteer
> with the golden reins of love.
> ~ (761--89)

> Suffer us to live here ... even in these straights
> our life is not as pitiful as you'd think,
> so long as we find joy in every hour.
> ~ (909--11)

Oedipus declaring his innocence to Creon, in front of Theseus and the Athenians:

> Unctuous, shameless---where do you think your insults
> do more damage, my old age or yours? Bloodshed
> incest, misery, all your mouth lets fly at me,
> I have suffered it all, and all against my will!
> Such was the pleasure of the gods, raging,
> perhaps, against our race from ages past.
> But as for me alone---
> say my unwilling crimes against myself
> and against my own were payment from the gods
> for something criminal deep inside me...no, look hard,
> you'll find no guilt to accuse me of---I am innocent!
> ...
> And my mother...
> wretched man, have you no shame? Your own sister!
> Her marriage---forcing me to talk of that marriage!
> Oh I'll tell it all, I won't be silent, not now,
> you and your blasphemous mouth have gone so far.
> She was my mother, yes, she bore me---
> oh the horror---I knew nothing, she knew nothing!---
> and once she'd born me then she bore me children,
> her disgrace. But at least I know one thing:
> you slander her and me of your own free will,
> but I made her my bride against my will,
> I repeat this to the world againnst my will. No,
> I'll not be branded guilty, not in that marriage,
> not in the murder of my father, all those crimes
> you heap on me relentlessly, harrowing my heart.
> ~ (1095--1131)
