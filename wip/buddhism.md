## Words

The *Sangha* is the monastic community of *bhikkus* (monks) and *bhikkunis* (nuns).

Dhamma

Tathāgata is a Pali and Sanskrit word; Gautama Buddha uses it when referring to himself in the Pāli Canon.

## The Three Vehicles

The Buddha was a _samyaksambuddha_. His awakened disciples are arhats, or _śrāvakabuddhas_. There is also a third type of buddha called a _pratyekabuddha_. These together comprise the three vehicles, or _yānas_, of Buddhism. Mahāyāna specifically refers to the path culminating in samyaksambuddhahood. The early traditions deemphasize the difference between these three types of awakening, and they are the same in their transcendence of suffering and of birth and death. However, samyaksambuddhas additionally posses a kind of omniscience and have perfected their teaching ability and compassion. Their role is to be born into a world system in which the Dharma is lost, rediscover the path to awakening, and teach the path to the world to initiate a stream of śrāvakabuddhas. Pratyekabuddhas are not really emphasized in any tradition: they awaken on their own, without hearing a samyaksambuddha’s dispensation, but they don’t themselves have the capacity or the inclination to teach.
