A metaphysical belief is "true" when it correctly describes reality.

An epistemological belief is "true" when, if it is followed, it leads us to true metaphysical beliefs.

An epistemological belief can be true while also not being useful.

Few, if any, beliefs are certain.  We can not "prove" many beliefs.

Still, we can and do use certain rules to establish how likely or unlikely beliefs are.

It is often useful to consider sets of interconnected beliefs---a "belief system."

One may ask if a set of beliefs is internally consistent---thus, in some cases, we can disprove the belief system without disproving any particular belief.

An internally consistent belief system may still be "wrong."

We are free agents existing in reality.  We begin our lives without consciousness and it slowly appears.  We can not escape our existence in reality, and our metaphysical and epistemological belief system must begin somewhere; we must adopt our first epistemological beliefs without a foundation.

Our epistemological and metaphysical beliefs are intertwined; we are bound by reality, and the assumptions we make about reality inform how we decide what we know about reality, and vice versa.

Our brains have a limited physical extent.

Language is limited, but not hopelessly so.
