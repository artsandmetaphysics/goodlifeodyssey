- You need to agree on the purpose of the discussion.
- You need to love the truth more than being correct.
- But don't agree just to be cordial and risk letting the truth escape (336e).
- You need to proceed orderly, with one person asking questions and the other person answering.
- The spoken word is more effective than the written, since the speaker can adapt to the listener.
- Thinking by yourself is fun, but, like feasting too much, it will make your soul soft (458a).
