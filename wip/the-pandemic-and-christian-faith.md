  The Pandemic and Christian Faith

  A dialogue about faith and deed.

Uncle:: What do you think about your governor's handling of the pandemic?

Dijon:: I haven't been reading the news much, but it seems clear that he tried to cover up how many people died as the result of his actions; he tried to hide how many elderly people died in nursing homes, partly because he directed recovering patients to return too soon.

Problem is the lieing; making mistakes is ok. Also, given the limited evidence, the government shouldn't dictate things. Discuss the masses "making the right choice".

Discuss the mainstream news media "You lie about somethings, so why should I trust you about anything?"

Discuss buddhism; talk about some things in Buddhism that are very appealing

Dijon:: Salvation by faith is the corrupt kernel at the heart of Christianity.

Discuss that it is the requirement to have faith, despite incomplete evidence, that is the problem.

Uncle:: How much evidence would you need to believe?

Dijon:: I don't think there is a sharp divide; I act proportionally to the evidence.

Uncle:: Give an example.

Dijon:: I believe enough to still take Christianity seriously, to read about it and listen to podcasts about it. I don't believe enough to attend church, for I feel my time is better spent doing other things than singing hymns to a god I'm not sure I believe it. Instead of donating to the church, I donate to other charities.

Discuss story about C.S. Lewis' conversion.

Discuss that christians still have doubts.

Uncle:: What do you think is the best evidence for Christianity.

Dijon:: I haven't read the new testament recently, but the old testament is a powerful and poetic book and one of our oldest. Yet, it is filled with inconsistencies and difficulties---some small, others larger.

I'm also impressed by the development of monotheism, while recognizing it's not as abrubt as apologists claim. Likewise, I'm impressed by the development of Israel's laws which are unique from their neighbors, although once again less so than sometimes said.

Uncle:: What about the evidence for Jesus' death?

Dijon:: I need to read mroe about this.

Uncle:: This is the fulcrum Christianity hinges upon.

Dijon:: I don't think you can separate the two so easily; Jesus viewed himself in terms of the old testament. If it isn't trustworthy, why would I believe in the New Tesatment?

The stronger the evidence for the ressurection in the new testament, the more willing I'd be to dismiss difficulties in the old testament. Yet, given some uncertainty, it seems like both must be factors.
