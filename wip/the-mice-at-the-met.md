In the city there is a park,
And in the park there is a museum,
And in the museum there is a vase,
And in the vase there lives a family---
mommy mouse, daddy mouse, and daughter mouse.

On sunny Saturdays they walk in the park.
They see people with dogs.
They see kids run in the grass.
They see birds fly and hop.
They see trees and flowers.

On rainy Saturdays they look at art.
They look at Greek vase.
They look at Roman sculptures.
Africa, European sculptures,

They look at Egyptian scrolls.
They look at Moghul miniatures.
British teapots
Persian

Their vase is small,
but they love the city,
and they love the park,
and they love the museum.
They love looking at art together.
