The word religion is difficult to define. Here, a religion is be a set of metaphysical claims (statements about the nature of reality) and ethical imperatives (statements about how one should act).

A religion can be said to be true if its metaphysical claims are true.

A religion that does not make metaphysical claims can not be true, nor can it be false.  Some religion's metaphysical claims are implicit, and must be deduced from its rituals and texts.  Other religion's claims are explicit in creeds and catechisms.

Metaphysical claims are less likely to be demonstrably true or false than physical claims.  Fortunately, most religions make physical claims as well as metaphysical claims.  Furthermore, the metaphysical claims tend to be justified from the physical claims.  We can use a religion's physical claims as a basis to evaluate the believability of its metaphysical claims.
