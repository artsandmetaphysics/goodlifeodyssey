  On Reading Old Books
description: >
  Are old books more worthy of our attention than the new?
---

One may read for entertainment, to gather information, or to gain understanding.

Reading books that were written before women could vote or slaves were free, during the depression, or in Victorian England lets us see our lives in contrast to something completely outside our experience. It gives whole new ways of looking at themes like diversity, gender roles, religion, love, family.

Sometimes old books highlight the differences between now and then, and sometimes they highlight the universality of the human condition---then, now and always.

Unless you are trying to achieve some goal (e.g. get a degree is something that requires reading), there are no books you "should" read. You should read books you enjoy, either in the simple sense of "enjoyment" or in the "it challenges me in a good way" sense. Enjoyable books have been written in all eras. Why limit yourself to the current one? That's like only eating at one restaurant. There's no reason you "should" eat at other restaurants, but you're missing out on some great food if you don't.

But who doesn't have any goal---any "idea of the good"? And how do we know we have the right idea? Great philosophy books can help here.

> Every age has its own outlook. It is specially good at seeing certain truths and specially liable to make certain mistakes. We all, therefore, need the books that will correct the characteristic mistakes of our own period. And that means the old books. All contemporary writers share to some extent the contemporary outlook---even those, like myself, who seem most opposed to it. Nothing strikes me more when I read the controversies of past ages than the fact that both sides were usually assuming without question a good deal which we should now absolutely deny. They thought that they were as completely opposed as two sides could be, but in fact they were all the time secretly united---united with each other and against earlier and later ages---by a great mass of common assumptions. We may be sure that the characteristic blindness of the twentieth century---the blindness about which posterity will ask, "But how could they have thought that?"---lies where we have never suspected it, and concerns something about which there is untroubled agreement between Hitler and President Roosevelt or between Mr. H. G. Wells and Karl Barth. None of us can fully escape this blindness, but we shall certainly increase it, and weaken our guard against it, if we read only modern books. Where they are true they will give us truths which we half knew already. Where they are false they will aggravate the error with which we are already dangerously ill. The only palliative is to keep the clean sea breeze of the centuries blowing through our minds, and this can be done only by reading old books. Not, of course, that there is any magic about the past. People were no cleverer then than they are now; they made as many mistakes as we. But not the same mistakes. They will not flatter us in the errors we are already committing; and their own errors, being now open and palpable, will not endanger us. Two heads are better than one, not because either is infallible, but because they are unlikely to go wrong in the same direction. To be sure, the books of the future would be just as good a corrective as the books of the past, but unfortunately we cannot get at them.

> A further reason we recommend living books is that the authors of these books typically provide excellent examples to their readers of how to think, not merely what to think. An exposition of how an author has arrived at a conclusion, or simply a narrative statement of their thoughtful observations can help readers better understand the reasoning process. It is particularly important for younger scientists and readers to see each observation and logical inference laid out in succession so that they are given a model for the step-wise process of scientific reasoning. We also find that living books tend to emphasize the observation process, which is another critical skill to model for students of all ages.

> Furthermore, as the scientific community continues to pursue difficult questions and continues to engage in research, ideas that have long been accepted as truth will be overturned. And it’s important for young scientists and students to understand that these changes are a natural---and even exciting---part of the trajectory of scientific discovery. Human understanding of scientific phenomena has changed significantly since the beginning of recorded history, and will continue to change as new discoveries are made. However, such discoveries do not necessarily render older findings useless, as those prior beliefs were often a necessary precursor to subsequent ones.

It’s vital for scientists to look at those invalidated beliefs and the observations that disproved them. Understanding the transitions from older beliefs to newer ones is the process of science, and is also the place, in my opinion, where the greatest educational efforts should be placed. It is examining this process that best teaches students how to think critically. Original texts and living science books serve as particularly invaluable resources in this regard.

- Older books provide an outstanding opportunity to study the history of science even as you study scientific material.
- The literary merit of older authors is often unmatched by their modern peers.
- Students gain a deeper and more nuanced understanding of the foundations of science, and the origins of scientific ideas.
- Readers can learn to critically evaluate primary sources for themselves.
- Modern readers may be astonished to learn just how much ancient and medieval scientists were able to discover with the limited tools available to them.
- It is far easier for students who have learned to think critically to learn newer material later on, once they have already established a strong intellectual foundational.

The arguments for and against a settled issue are simplified as the years pass and the need for subtlety, to convince the opponents, fades away. Therefore, an issue may be explored best in the books written at the pinnacle of disagreement. For example, I suspect the theological arguments for and against the doctrine of the trinity were better known, and more clearly formulated, in the 2nd to 6th centuries AD than today.

Familiarity with our widely-read books is the admission price to the conversation between our philosophers and poets. Without this familiarity, one is left peering in from a distance, missing much of what is said in the great room.

---

Many Western artists assumed their audience was familiar with the Bible, Homer, Virgil, Ovid, and Dante. Without this, many great paintings and sculptures loose their essential power.

It's natural to feel insignificant in a democracy, since political power is spread evenly and the high-things are thought to be snobbish. This feeling can reduce ambition. Reading about great warriors and statesmen, heroines and heroes, can keep our ambitions lit, propelling us to be our best selves.

Reading old books shows us that the generations are defined more by the issues they care about then the sides they take on them. It becomes clear when issues, which we are unaware of, are passionately debated. For example, Plato argues that the written word makes people forgetful. This historical perspective is encouraging---for we're not so far from our contemporaries as we may thing. It also gives us a scent to track down deep and forgotten truths, for our modern consensus on some of these old issues may be incorrect. Maybe Plato is right and we should exercise our memory more than we do.

Terms model, or abstract, the world. Reading literal translations of old writers can make us more aware of alternative models. E.g., Buddhists have a unique set of terms which don't map easily to English terms. Similarly, Plato has different models.
