Bloom's showed me several new reasons to dislike value-relativism. For example, if one believes all cultures are equally good, then why bother learning about other cultures? If you believe there is a standard, one may, like Herodotus, seek the better in other them.

In chapter 26, Bloom implies that thinking about virtue was sufficient for Socrates. I believe Socrates thought his particular role was to contemplate virtue, since the Oracle at Delphi told him to. He didn't think all men were like this. Also, Plato, as demonstrated in his letters, thought his political ideas should be applied.
