Bloom was an elitist curmudgeon, but I suspect his assessment of our culture in _The Closing of the American Mind_, was more right than wrong.

## The Beauty of Science


Bloom gave me new reasons to dislike value-relativism. For example, if one believes all cultures are equally good, then why bother learning about other cultures? If you believe there is a standard, one may, like Herodotus, seek the better in other them.

In chapter 26, Bloom implies that thinking about virtue was sufficient for Socrates. I believe Socrates thought his particular role was to contemplate virtue, since the Oracle at Delphi told him to. He didn't think all men were like this. Also, Plato, as demonstrated in his letters, thought his political ideas should be applied.

## Education

_The Closing of the American Mind_ captivates me for several reasons. First, because it explores questions I've long thought about: Can we judge paintings or morals? And why should we read the classics? Second, because I'm a teacher---in a small way for my employees and in soon to be a big way for my infant daughter. Since Bloom taught for thirty years to students in across the world, in Ithaca, Toronto, Tel Aviv, New Haven, Paris, and finally Chicago, I'm eager to absorb his wisdom.

His first educational lesson is in the preface: The effective educator appeals to their student's needs. "For there is no real education that does not respond to felt need; anything else acquired is trifling display." Here's how I apply this to my company: A felt need is essential and difficult to create. Thus, we must find people with felt needs that we can fan into healthy flames that burn for our shared mission. Further, the purpose of our lessons must be tied to the mission and to the person's career growth. Here's how I apply this to my daughter: The relationship will be longer and the closer, so I may be able to create a felt need. Without the felt need, other efforts will fail.

"Every educational system has a moral goal that it tries to attain and that informs its curriculum. It wants to create a certain kind of human being."

"Education is not sermonizing to children against their instincts and pleasures, but providing a natural continuity between what they feel and what they can and should be."

## Popular Culture

> Lack of education simply results in students' seeking for enlightenment wherever it is readily available, without being able to distinguish between the sublime and trash, insight and propaganda. For the most part students turn to the movies, ready prey to interested moralisms such as the depictions of Gandhi or Thomas More---largely designed to further passing political movements and to appeal to simplistic needs for greatness---or to insinuate flatter of their secret aspirations and vices, giving them a sense of significance.

> Rock music provides premature ecstasy and, in this respect, is like the drugs with which it is allied. It artificially induces the exaltation naturally attached to the completion of the greatest endeavors---victory in a just war, consummated love, artistic creation, religious devotion, and discovery of the truth. Without effort, without talent, without exercise of the faculties, anyone and everyone is accorded the equal right to the enjoyment of their fruits. In my experience, students who have had a serious fling with drugs---and gotten over it---find it difficult to have enthusiasms or great expectations. It is as though the color has been drained out of their lives.

## The Cause of Moral Relativism

Consenting to freedom of religion means that religion is a matter of opinion. It is not a fact, or, if it is deemed a fact, its not demonstrable.

## The Effects of Moral Relativism

## The Alternative to Moral Relativism

Bloom denigrates relativism and shows us its symptoms, but he only hints at alternatives: "'Are you an absolutist?,' the only alternative they know, uttered in the same tone as 'Are you a monarchist?'" he writes on the first page, as if there was a middle ground.

Absolum:: There is no middle ground. Is it okay rape widows and prostitute orphans?

Relativo:: No, but that is an extreme---

Absolum:: Why isn't it okay?

Relativo:: No culture would condone such terrible actions.

Absolum:: But what if there was such a culture?

Relativo:: Well, we've evolved to have a certain moral sentiments.

Absolum:: Then imagine genetically modified humans---soldiers, made to kill without regret for their regime, like the ideal guardians of Plato's Republic. Would it be wrong for these mutant soldiers to rape widows and prostitute orphans? Now don't start blushing---

Relativo:: Okay, I never said there are no absolutes! You've given an extreme example, but most moral questions depend on the situation. What's right for one group may not be right for another.

Absolum:: I have no problem with this. It's right for a Japanese boy to bow, for french friends to kiss, and for Americans to shake or bump. But everyone should follow the local etiquette. This isn't relativism, but a recognition that morality is more complex than commandments.

Relativo:: But thou shalt not rape widows.

Absolum:: There may be some absolutes, but there may not be. Perhaps there are situations when raping a widow is right. The correct morality may be entirely situational, yet also be absolute.
