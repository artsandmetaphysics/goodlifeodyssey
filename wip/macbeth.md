## Dialogue Fragment: Why Read Macbeth

S:: Why is "Macbeth" more worth our time than our television shows?
D:: I disagree with the premise. There's a time for Shakespeare and a time for not Shakespeare.
S:: I'll rephrase: when should someone prefer "Macbeth" to television?
D:: You prejudge television---is it not a brighter heaven of invention than was the Globe? Couldn't a Shakespeare of the screen surpass his acts in their season? And hasn't he, through so many movied stagings, adapted? Blame not the medium but only it's poor practitioners and the clamors of those capable of nothing but dumb plots and effects. Swing once more, for your words have missed again!
S:: Why is some art better than other art?
D:: That is, what makes "Macbeth" good.
S:: Yes. It can't be that it's more entertaining.
D:: It may only be less accessible, but like coffee, grow from bitter beginning into warm comfort.

## Questions

Who was worse, Lady Macbeth or Macbeth?

Macbeth likely wouldn't have killed Macdonald if not for his Lady spurring him on, yet he did the deed. He hired Banquo's murderers. He had Macduff's family slain. He was the tyrant while her guilt drove her insane.

How does the phrase "fair is foul and foul is fair" characterize the play?

MacBeth's opening line: "So foul and fair a day I have not seen."

King Macdonald's comment about the Thane of Cawdor:

> There's no art
> To find the mind's construction in the face.
> He was a gentleman on whom I built
> an absolute trust.

Yet then he immediately praises MacBeth as his "worthiest cousin," ironically highlighting how foul and fair can be confused.

Lady Macbeth urges her husband to "Look like th'innocent flower, / But be the serpent under't" in Act II and in Act III urges him to "Sleek o'er your rugged looks. Be bright and jovial / Among your guests tonight." He then urges her to do the same:

> Let your remembrance
> Apply to Banquo; present him eminence
> Both with eye and tongue---unsafe the while, that we
> Must lave our honors in these flattering streams
> And make our faces vizards to our hearts,
> Disguising what they are.

I venture Malcolm is the foul that becomes fair, where in Act IV scene III he calls himself tyrant to test Macduff's intentions, and, in so doing nicely outlines what it means to be a tyrant. I hear echos of Plato's _Republic_, be they there or not.

## Quotes

Macbeth's descent into nihilism is vividly portrayed in his response to his Lady's death:

> Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
> Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
> To the last syllable of recorded time,
> And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
> The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle.
> Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player
> That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
> And then is heard no more. It is a tale
> Told by an idiot, full of sound and furry,
> Signifying nothing.
> ~ (5.5.19--28)
