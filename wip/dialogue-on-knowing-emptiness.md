Dijon:: Happy New Year!

Eurus:: Happy New Year! I hope our discussion leads to new ideas or new confidence in old ones.

Dijon:: I bought two translations of Nāgārjuna's _Mūlamadhyamakakārikā_, and read several chapters.

Eurus:: Which translations?

Dijon:: Garfield's and the joint translation by Siderits and Katsura.

Eurus:: What did you think?

Dijon:: It's dense.

Eurus:: It is. I believed it was meant to be accompanied and expanded upon by additional commentary. Nāgārjuna's verses are more like mnemonic outline of his thoughts than something to be understood on its own.

Dijon:: Siderits' mentioned this in his introduction. Given this is the case, it seems we should rely on the ancient commentators to decompress Nāgārjuna's meaning.  Yet Garfield sometimes seems more focused on his own ideas and interpretation.

This leads me to ask: am I reading to learn Nāgārjuna's views, or to learn the correct views? Like Garfield says, "who is to say that Nāgārjuna is the best possible interpreter of _Mūlamadhyamakakārikā_?" Maybe the ancient commentators misinterpret Nāgārjuna's views, yet they're more correct?

Eurus:: You're right to care more about knowing the correct views than knowing Nāgārjuna's views. One of the views, which I think is correct, is that nothing has svabhāva---essence, inherent existence, or true identity.

Dijon:: In our previous discussion, we considered whether this position could be verified by examining the physical world. We found, to a remarkable degree, it can be. It seems that the universe is in some sense a single entangled and evolving wave function. Even particles, often thought of as fundamental, are just ways of talking about this wave function. Thus, only this wave function could have svabhāva. We didn't come to a consensus as to whether the consistent behavior of this wave function, which the laws of physics describe, can be called its svabhāva.

At this point, you reflected that any correspondence between the Madhyamaka Buddhist tenant that nothing has svabhāva, and physics, may be coincidental. Since the tenant is a metaphysical claim about things-in-themselves, and since the methods of the physical science can't access things-in-themselves, physics is incapable of prooving or disprooving that nothing has svabhāva.

Eurus:: That's right. This can be illustrated by considering dreams: suppose that you performed the double slit experiment in a dream and the results coincided with our current understanding of quantum mechanics. Would the wave function from the dream have svabhāva?

Dijon:: My dreams operate inconsistently and bizarrely. Furthermore, everything in them dream originates from my own mind; the closest anything is to being new or independent of my mind would be simple super-positions of existing memories. In such a dream, the double slit experiment, and the knowledge of the wave function that I would infer from it, are reflections of the waking-life quantum mechanics.

Eurus:: What if the dream were perfectly realistic?

Dijon:: If the dream was perfectly realistic, it would operate consistently. Experiment would produce consistent results. There'd be fellow scientists in the dream, experimenting and writing papers. Unique and surprising events, not originating from my memories, would demonstrate to myself, in the dream, that the world of the dream is independent of my dream mind.

If "my" mind were capable of generating an entire consistent and independent dream world, then it seems like it may as well not be called "my" mind. It would be more like a computer simulation. Some people think our reality is like this---we are in a simulation or the "mind of God". Either could be true. Without revelation of some sort, there is no way for us to know for certain either way. Likewise, we couldn't know if the wave function has svabhāva.

This leads one to ask, how could Nāgārjuna know that nothing has svabhāva? And how can we know he's correct? I, with my upbringing among Abrahamic religions, too quickly concluded that divine revelation would be required. You awakened me to the possibility knowledge through _direct perception_.

When I read _Mūlamadhyamakakārikā_, it seems to me like he's trying to demonstrate it with reasoning from empirical observations. Yet, you're saying it's known through _direct perception_. You began explaining how this is possible, but I'd like to know more about it.

Eurus:: TODO: fill in answer; key ideas, direct perception provides certain knowledge.

TODO Discuss how direct perception stops the epistemological regress of knowing that you know. I.e., unlike our direct sensory observations here, which can be wrong like optical illusions, knowledge through direct perception stops the infinite epistemological regress.

Eurus:: That Buddhism's tenants come from direct perception, and not another authority, is a key distinction between Christianity and Buddhism.

Christians tenants get their authority from the ancient texts. Therefore, they must preserve and interpret these texts correctly. This textual source of authority leads to many difficulties. What texts are sacred? Have they been copied correctly? Are we interpreting their language correctly?

The Christian's unenviable situation is made worse because their eternal salvation depends on _faith_. Thus faith becomes the highest virtue. What is faith really, though? Growing up around contemporary Christian organizations, I was taught that faith means believing something blindly---

Dijon:: Must faith be _blind_? Christianity, like Buddhism, has many branches, and few encourage blind faith. I grew up attending a Lutheran church. Like Roman Catholics, they taught that faith should be buttressed by reason---

Eurus:: Blind or partially blind, faith is believing something with incomplete evidence. Salvation in Buddhism is through wisdom---knowledge, not faith. Prior to awakening, there will be doubt, because doubt is only eradicated through knowledge, not through faith.

Buddhists have faith too, but it doesn't save you; some tenants are unknowable prior to awakening. Other tenants are knowable prior to awakening, and these are gradually verified as one practices. As one reflects on the teachings of the Buddha, it becomes increasingly clear that he was extremely wise, and one's faith increases. This type of faith---the authentic kind, generated through contemplating and testing the teachings---is healthy. It commits one to the path. But there isn't any imperative of believe, even while practicing.

Dijon:: So a Buddhist's faith only matters to the extent that it produces action.

Eurus:: That's right. Furthermore, no faith will be required in the end, because everything can be verified directly.

Dijon:: Although Paul and Jesus didn't expand much on this, many Christians suspect God will answer their questions in heaven. So, in a way, Christian faith won't be required in the end either.

Eurus:: But faith was required to _get into_ heaven. You must believe Jesus was your savior, despite incomplete evidence, to be saved. This isn't the case for the Buddhist.

Dijon:: Your distinction may be less meaningful than it seems. Imagine a child who is born the same year as the Buddha, in classical Greece. His father sacrifices goats to Zeus. His mother hums hymns to Hera. Their polis holds parades and competitions for the gods. He knows none of the noble truths. The child dies and is reincarnated in Persian Egypt. And then in the Zhou dynasty in China. And on and on.

Occasionally they child is born in a Buddhist country. They donate to the sangha and participate in their town's rituals, but they are busy farming.

The child is born in a Christian country. Their parents are Christian. Their friends are nominally Christian. They read about Buddhism, but it seems odd. They equate nirvana with non-existence. "It's so pessimistic and life-denying." The child grows old and dies. And on and on. Why are you laughing?

Eurus:: I'm laughing because detail the ancient Greek and American reincarnations more than the eastern ones.

Dijon:: It's true, I know the most about what is in front of me and of what I've chosen to read about. I couldn't say what the Buddhist's rituals would be!

Eurus:: Sorry to interrupt, please continue.

Dijon:: So what happens if Buddhism goes extinct, like it largely has in it's homeland, but our child still hasn't stepped down the Buddhist path? Isn't the child's lack of faith preventing their salvation?

Eurus:: If Buddhism as we know it goes extinct, it will only re-emerge again. Three millennia is not very long. "How long is an eon," a monk once asked the Buddha? He says it's not easy to count, but he gives him a simile instead: "Suppose, monk, there was a great stone mountain a _yojana_ long, a _yojana_ wide, and a _yojana_ high, without holes ore crevices, one sold mass of rock. At the end of every hundred years a man would stroke it once with a piece of fine cloth. That great stone mountain might by this effort be worn away and eliminated but the eon would still not come to an end."

Yet even if this child is stuck in circles forever, what of it? The universe is the way it is. We are fortunate that there is such a thing as Nirvana and that there is a noble eightfold path to reach it.

My problem with Christianity isn't that some are damned but that some are damned by an all-loving God based on their beliefs about something that can't be known for certain. Dead Greek and Chinese children pose an inconsistency problem for Christianity, not Buddhism.

Dijon:: I've been playing the devil's advocate, but I agree with you. Salvation by faith is my biggest objection to protestantism and Christianity in general. 

I imagine walking along a narrow draw bridge made of fluffy clouds, naked. The sun is bright but not oppressive and the sky is pleasantly blue. I reach the other side, and there is a white gate. I plead with the man there, who says I can't enter: "I wanted to believe! I wanted to believe in an all-loving God who cares about me. I wanted to believe in this beautiful place. I'm glad it exists! Please let me enter. I want to meet God and talk to my grandparents. I studied the bible carefully. I examined the historical evidence as best I could. They didn't seem convincing. I looked for miracles and other assurances, but found nothing. After moving on from Christianity, I searched for the good life as best as I could, although it was beyond a haze. I made bad choices along the way. Sometimes I did what I know I shouldn't, maybe even because I didn't believe. Please! I don't even need answers, just please don't send me to hell!"

So I agree: Buddhist _faith_ seems less problematic than Christian faith.

Earlier you contrasted Christianity and Buddhism, saying Christian tenant's get their authority from the Bible. I presume Buddhism's tenants do _not_ get their authority from it's texts.

Eurus:: That's right. I don't want to imply that Buddhist scriptures and traditions are unimportant. While Buddhism has a vast literature, the real teaching of the Buddha is realization itself. That realization has been passed down to the present day through a multitude of monastic communities. Therefore the noble Saṃgha is effectively a direct connection to the Buddha himself. Some disciples in these communities have had the same realization as the Buddha did---at least in regards to being liberated from saṃsāra.

In Christianity, on the other hand, nobody after Jesus shared his realization, nor is that even possible, because we are not God and we never will be. There is no living embodiment of Christ's wisdom, so all we have to guide us are the written words.

Dijon:: So, despite the importance of the texts and traditions, Buddhism's tenants get their authority from direct perception.

Eurus:: Correct.

Dijon:: If all of the tenants of Buddhism can be verified by direct perception, then what aspects of the Buddha's realization are different from his disciples?

Eurus:: TODO fill in answer.

Dijon:: Your comments make me think about the Roman Catholic church. Their popes form a direct connection to Jesus, beginning with Peter. The authority of their tenants originate in the teachings of Jesus, and the ancient texts. However, the popes are thought to be guided by God---to be the living embodiment of Christ's wisdom and a means to provide the proper interpretation of the texts. Their Nāgārjuna, Thomas Aquinas, thought all their teachings could be verified with reason, except five: the creation of the world out of nothing, the Trinity, the incarnation, the sacraments, and eternal life.

Eurus:: I'm not too familiar with Roman Catholicism, so some of my earlier comments may not apply as well to them. However, the essential epistemological difference between Christianity and Buddhism remains: the individual can _directly verify_ reincarnation, law of karma, and the four noble truths once they are far enough down the path. As you said, the individual can not directly verify some central Christian beliefs. That is, unless they are fortunate enough to be given a private revelation from God.

Dijon:: You're right, this is an essential difference. Since the supreme Buddhist authority is _direct verification_ of its tenants, then why does the unbroken connection back to the Buddha matter? Couldn't someone verify these beliefs on their own?

Eurus:: Few can find the path without guidance. Thus, the unbroken connection matters because there are still living individuals who've walked the path Buddha did and can lead the next generation down it. Buddhism will die out, but in another eon the path will be found again and the cycle will continue.

Dijon:: So protestantism has texts, Catholicism has the pope's interpretation of texts, Buddhism has _direct verification_, and science has experimentation.

If Buddhism, like science, provides a means to directly verify its tenants, wouldn't you expect it to remain uniform? Protestantism, because texts can be interpreted many ways, is a great tree. Large branches like Lutheranism divide into smaller ones. On the other hand, science begins with division, but joins together as repeatable experimentation produces a consensus. 

Eurus:: TODO fill in answer

TODO: ask whether, given the infallibility of direct perception, how there can be mistakes in the teachings. Dalai lama quote:

> This means that, in the Buddhist investigation of reality, at least in principle, empirical evidence should triumph over scriptural authority, no matter how deeply venerated a scripture may be. Even in the case of knowledge derived through reason or inference, its validity must derive ultimately from some observed facts of experience. Because of this methodological standpoint, I have often remarked to my Buddhist colleagues that the empirically verified insights of modern cosmology and astronomy must compel us now to modify, or in some cases reject, many aspects of traditional cosmology as found in ancient Buddhist texts.

Response to Zach:

I'll start with a few easy things:

> However, if I then infer from this that, were I to actually measure the lines (say, with a ruler), they would measure at different lengths, then I would be asserting a proposition that is not drawn by direct perception.

I think you're absolutely right. The epistemological regress only applies to inferences drawn from sense data or from memories of past sense data, but not to the immediately available sense data or the immediately available memories.

Also, I enjoyed reading your quotes from Longchenpa’s Eight Similes of Illusion, Dharmadhātustava, Mahāprajñāpāramitā Upadeśa and your explanation of multiple realms. I wasn't able to connect much of this to the main line of our discussion, but it is helpful context. I can certainly imagine a reality where animals and humans live in different realms---it’s pretty cool!  

> It may be a bit too strong to say that it is definitely a coincidental. I think that physics can neither prove nor disprove emptiness because emptiness is a metaphysical insight, not a mathematical model of the conventional world: the question is ultimately beyond the reach of physics. However, it seems at least somewhat plausible that the parallels that we see in physics are somehow related to the underlying metaphysical truth. Maybe it would just make sense to change "is" to "may be," because I don't really know.

I completely agree. For example, if we existed in a computer simulation that is run in a dramatically different universe, then it would be fair to say our physics and the underlying metaphysics of reality are decoupled; in this case, any similarity or difference is coincidental. However, as you say, one can also imagine that physics and metaphysics are related. E.g., the laws of physics are the tip of a deeper metaphysical iceberg, not fully known but consistent and related to what we can see.

Later you say:

> I think that we are on the same page that physics can’t tell us anything about things-in-themselves.

I may be misunderstanding, but this seems to contradict the opening statements. I would adjust this slightly to say that "physics can't _prove_ anything about the things-in-themselves," since, as we said earlier, physics may actually be related somehow to the things-in-themselves. Would you agree, or am I misunderstanding something?

Furthermore, while it may be impossible to _prove_ anything beyond direct perception, I think one may think many things are _reasonable_. I'll quote from a short book by Bertrand Russell, which says this nicely:

> Of course it is not by argument that we originally come by our belief in an independent external world. We find this belief in ourselves as soon as we begin to reflect: it is what may be called an _instinctive_ belief ...
>
> Philosophy should show us the hierarchy of our instinctive beliefs, beginning with those we hold most strongly [e.g., our acquaintance with sense data], and presenting each as much isolated and as free from irrelevant additions as possible. It should take care to show that, in the form in which they are finally set forth, our instinctive beliefs do not clash, but form a harmonious system ...
>
> It is of course _possible_ that all or any of our beliefs may be mistaken, and therefore all ought to be held with at least some slight element of doubt. But we cannot have _reason_ to reject a belief except on the ground of some other belief. Hence, by organizing our instinctive beliefs and their consequences, by considering which among them is most possible, if necessary, to modify or abandon, we can arrive, on the basis of accepting as our sole data what we instinctively believe, at an orderly systematic organization of our knowledge, in which, though the _possibility_ of error remains, its likelihood is diminished by the interrelation of the parts and by the critical scrutiny which was preceded acquiescence.

These paragraphs succinctly describe what has been my epistemological worldview for sometime.

In the course of our discussions about svabhāva you've taught me about a new means of gathering knowledge. I would call this new source of knowledge _direct perception_, however, we've been using that term not only for acquaintance with sense data but also the infallible acquaintance with deeper truths about the world, such as "nothing has svabhāva." Therefore, I will refer to it with the phrase _direct perception of deep metaphysical truths_. This is somewhat verbose so let me know if you have a better term.

While I can't rely on realizing _direct perception of deep metaphysical truths_ myself, I've been trying to understand its implications. I've mentioned two of these implications in the dialogue.

First, I would expect that Buddhism, to the extent its founded on _direct perception of deep metaphysical truths_, to evolve more like our understanding of physics and less like the denominations of Protestantism. I look forward to hearing your thoughts about this, because it seems like strong evidence that is available to me prior to realizing direct perception of the deep metaphysical truths myself.

Second, since Nāgārjuna presumably had the _direct perception of deep metaphysical truths_, it leaves me wondering what he was trying to accomplish by writing the _Mūlamadhyamakakārikā_. Nāgārjuna is engaging in philosophical debate, however, many of not most of his arguments are founded in empirical observations. For example, in chapter 10, he says:

> If the fuel were identical with the fire, then agent and object would be one.
> If fire were distinct from fuel, then there would be fire without fuel.
> Fire would be always alight; it would be without a cause of lighting.
> A second beginning is pointless, and if it were so it would be devoid of object.
> Because it is not dependent on another, it is without a cause of lighting.
> It being permanently alight, it would follow that restarting is pointless.

My interpretation, which Garfield and Siderits confirmed, is that this argument depends on empirical observations of fire---in particular that it doesn't light itself.

Thus, it seems Nāgārjuna believes we can use empirical observations to help us reason about deep metaphysical truths. I'm sure he thought, like we do, that there are limits to how far you can get this way; in the end, you will need to directly perceive the deep metaphysical truths. However, it would seem that he thinks physics can tell us something useful, if not prove anything, about deep metaphysical truths.

There is another possibility: He may know all of his arguments are ill-founded or irrelevant, yet believe they can point other ignorant souls down the right path. If this were true, he'd be misleading us for our own good. I don't get the sense this is what he is doing, but I'd like to know what you think.

Okay, so now finally I'll turn to your comments about idealism:

> In general, we can only know the mind and its appearances directly. Anything that is not the mind is, by definition, unknowable, because the mind is the only thing that has the ability to know.

So, as you may know, a different flavor of idealism was prominent in Britain not that long ago. In fact, for a while it was the majority opinion. I think it was Bertrand Russell and Whitehead who effectively argued against it and these days its now uncommon. In the same little book I quoted from earlier, he directly addresses this statement you made. I'm out of time, so I'll try to summarize his argument and present it soon.

I also need to address your comment: "I would actually argue that claiming that the wave function has an essence on the basis of it exhibiting consistent behavior is playing a game of semantics."

It is quite likely that this definition of essence would have been foreign to Nāgārjuna. In Siderits' introduction, he says that Nāgārjuna believed that if anything were to have svabhāva, it would be the dharmas. However, modern physics has shown that the Abhidharma worldview that Nāgārjuna was arguing against, is misguided. (For what its worth, all of the metaphysical worldviews of the ancient world were quite mistaken---including those in the bible and in the ancient Greeks.)

Therefore, while I agree with you that "claiming the wave function has an essence on the basis of it exhibiting consistent behavior is playing a game of semantics," I think it is the right game to play. Nāgārjuna may have convincingly rebuffed the Abhidharma worldview, but I think we now must rebuff modern physics, perhaps using his method of argumentation as a foundation to build upon.

Perhaps we can avoid the semantic difficulty by asking: do the ethical imperatives he drew from the statement that "nothing has svabhāva" still follow, given that the behaviour of the universe's wavefunction exhibits consistent behaviour? If they do follow, then perhaps it doesn't matter if we redefine svabhāva or replace it with a new one.

I enjoyed reading your quotes from Longchenpa's Eight Similes of Illusion, _Dharmadhātustava_, _Mahāprajñāpāramitā Upadeśa_ and your explanation of multiple realms. I can certainly imagine a reality where animals and humans live in different realms---it's pretty cool! I also like think your explanation of Karma is interesting:

> This also ties into how karma works: your karma doesn't literally send you somewhere after you die; it simply conditions the mind to perceive reality in a certain way, and that determines what realm you connect with after death.

Ok, so I'm going to go on a bit of tangent, but I think it will tie together in the end. Your quote from the _Dharmadhātustava_ says "butter, though inherent in the milk, is mixed with it and hence does not appear."

What do they mean by "butter is inherent in the milk?" I doubt it means merely that "butter can be created from milk," since one can hypothetically create just about anything from anything else, given enough energy---a person could be said to exist inherently in a block of stone. Thus, perhaps the phrase means "butter can be created _relatively easily_ from milk _without adding things_." Even this, though, doesn't seem satisfactory, since we could then say "canoes are inherent in trees." I think if we explored the semantics of the phrase "x is inherent in y" for sometime we'd end up with a lot of definitions that are too broad and other's that are too specific.

Natural language lays many traps for us when we talk about metaphysics. I think our modern scientific understanding of the world helps us avoid many of these traps. As I've read more of MMK, I've started to get the feeling that he is caught in a few of these traps. For example, in chapter 10, he says:

> If the fuel were identical with the fire, then agent and object would be one.
> If fire were distinct from fuel, then there would be fire without fuel.
> Fire would be always alight; it would be without a cause of lighting.
> A second beginning is pointless, and if it were so it would be devoid of object.
> Because it is not dependent on another, it is without a cause of lighting.
> It being permanently alight, it would follow that restarting is pointless.
