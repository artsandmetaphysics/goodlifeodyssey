Dijon:: Happy New Year!

Eurus:: Happy New Year! I hope our discussion leads to new ideas or new confidence in old ones.

Dijon:: I bought two translations of Nāgārjuna's _Mūlamadhyamakakārikā_, and read several chapters.

Eurus:: What translations?

Dijon:: Jay L. Garfield's and the joint translation by Mark Siderits and Shōryū Katsura.

Eurus:: What did you think?

Dijon:: It's dense but interesting.

Eurus:: I believe it was meant to be notes more so than something to be fully understood by itself.

Dijon:: Siderits' introduction mentioned this. Given this is the case, it seems we should rely on the interpretations of the ancient commentators to uncompress Nāgārjuna's meaning; they likely had oral or lost written sources we do not. Yet Garfield seems to eschew them for his own interpretation. For this reason, I prefer the _Siderits_ translation.

This leads me to ask: am I reading to learn Nāgārjuna's views, or to learn the correct views? Couldn't Garfield or the ancient commentators misinterpret Nāgārjuna, yet be more correct? If I can't identify the correct views when I hear or experience them, then why believe one person more than another?

Eurus:: I haven't read _Siderits_, but I think you are right to care more about knowing the correct views than knowing Nāgārjuna's views. I want to point out that this is a key distinction between Christianity, and most revealed religions, and Buddhism.

Christians must care more about exegesis because the authority of their tenants originates in ancient texts. Therefore, they must preserve and interpret them correctly. This leads to many difficulties. What texts are sacred? Have they been copied correctly? Are we interpreting their language correctly?

The doubting Christian's unenviable situation is made worse because their religion demands _belief_ to attain salvation. This leads to a bastardization of faith---faith becomes the highest virtue. What is faith really, though? Growing up around contemporary Christian organizations, I was taught that faith means believing something blindly---

Dijon:: Must faith be _blind_? Christianity, like Buddhism, has many branches, and few encourage blind faith. I grew up attending a Lutheran church. Like Roman Catholics, they taught that faith should be buttressed by reason---

Eurus:: Blind or partially blind, faith is believing something with incomplete evidence. Salvation in Buddhism is through wisdom---knowledge, not faith. Prior to awakening, there will be doubt, because doubt is only eradicated through knowledge, not through faith.

Buddhists have faith too, but it's not the source of salvation. Some tenants are unknowable prior to awakening. Other tenants are knowable prior to awakening, and these are gradually verified as one practices. As one reflects on the teachings of the Buddha, it becomes increasingly clear that he was extremely wise, and one's faith increases. This type of faith---the authentic kind, generated through contemplating and testing the teachings---is healthy. It commits one to the path. But there isn't any imperative of belief, even while practicing.

Dijon:: So faith isn't a virtue in-and-of-itself, but only to the extent that it motivates action.

Eurus:: That's right.

Furthermore, faith isn't needed in the end. All of the tenants of Buddhism can be verified directly.

I don't want to imply that Buddhist scriptures and traditions are unimportant. Buddhism has a vast literature which is a sign pointing us in the right direction.  The real teaching of the Buddha is realization itself. Furthermore, the Buddha's realization has been passed down to the present day through a multitude of monastic communities. There are living disciples who have the same realization as the Buddha did---at least in regards to being liberated from saṃsāra. In Christianity, on the other hand, nobody after Jesus shared his realization, nor is that even possible, because we are not God and we never will be. There is no living embodiment of Christ's wisdom, so all we have to guide us are the written words.

So, despite the importance of the texts and traditions, Buddhism's tenants get their authority from direct perception.

Dijon:: It sounds like you grew up in a protestant church; Roman Catholics are not too far from the Buddhist situation. Their popes form a direct link back to Jesus. And they are thought to be inspired by God---to be the living embodiment of Christ's wisdom. They also believe that the vast majority of their beliefs

Dijon:: If all of the tenants of Buddhism can be verified by direct perception, then what aspects of the realization are different?

Eurus:: TODO fill in answer.

Dijon::

TODO: ask whether there can be mistakes in the teachings. Have Eurus quote the dalai lama saying:

> This means that, in the Buddhist investigation of reality, at least in principle, empirical evidence should triumph over scriptural authority, no matter how deeply venerated a scripture may be. Even in the case of knowledge derived through reason or inference, its validity must derive ultimately from some observed facts of experience. Because of this methodological standpoint, I have often remarked to my Buddhist colleagues that the empirically verified insights of modern cosmology and astronomy must compel us now to modify, or in some cases reject, many aspects of traditional cosmology as found in ancient Buddhist texts.

TODO: comparison with Catholicism and the parts of their belief that can be verified rationally here, vs the few things that can't be known without faith. Ultimately, thought, agree that the need for any faith is problematic. In particular, the chain of the Popes going back to Jesus is similar to the Sangha. Also, the point of faith vs deed.

TODO: discuss what would happen if all of the Buddhist texts disappeared

Eurus::

Dijon:: Last time we discussed the Madhyamaka Buddhist tenant that nothing has svabhāva---essence, inherent existence, or true identity. We considered whether our physical understanding of the world acquiesce to this idea, and found, to a remarkable degree, they do. It seems that the universe is in some sense a single entangled and evolving wave function. Even particles, often thought of as fundamental, are just ways of talking about this wave function. Thus, only this wave function could have svabhāva. We didn't come to a consensus as to whether the consistent behavior of this wave function, which the laws of physics describe, can be called its svabhāva.

At this point, you reflected that any correspondence between the Madhyamaka Buddhist tenant that nothing has svabhāva, and physics, is coincidental. Since the tenant is a metaphysical claim about things-in-themselves, and since the methods of the physical science can't access things-in-themselves, physics is incapable of answering our question.

Eurus:: That's right. This can be illustrated by considering dreams: suppose that you performed the double slit experiment in a dream and the results coincided with our current understanding of quantum mechanics. Would the wave function from the dream have svabhāva?

Dijon:: My dreams operate inconsistently and bizarrely. Furthermore, everything in them dream originates from my own mind; the closest anything is to being new or independent of my mind would be simple super-positions of existing memories. In such a dream, the double slit experiment, and the knowledge of the wave function that I would infer from it, are reflections of the waking-life quantum mechanics.

Eurus:: What if the dream were realistic?

Dijon:: If a dream world were realistic, it would operate consistently. The double slit experiment would produce consistent results. Perhaps there are fellow scientists in the dream, experimenting and writing papers. Unique and surprising events, not originating from my memories, would demonstrate to myself, in the dream, that the world of the dream is independent of my dream mind.

If "my" mind were capable of generating an entire consistent and independent dream world, then it seems like it may as well not be called "my" mind. It would be more like a computer simulation. Some people think our reality is like this---we are in a simulation or the "mind of God". Either could be true. Without revelation of some sort, there is no way for us to know for certain either way. Likewise, we couldn't know if the wave function has svabhāva.

Eurus:: And wouldn't you agree that it would be impossible to

Thus, it would not be possible to distinguish dream quantum mechanics from waking-life quantum mechanics.

I think the second dream's wave function fundamentally exists, but for different reasons. The fact that the wave function was produced by my mind has now become an inaccessible metaphysical implementation detail; I would have no way of knowing about it, unless they were somehow revealed to me, say when I woke up.

Eurus:: Your answer highlights why your definition of _fundamentally exist_ is unsatisfactory. By defining it to always be meaningful to the scientist you've made it apply to dream wave functions. Realizing śūnyatā, or emptiness, is like waking up from such a dream.

Dijon:: I'm not denying that it's _possible_ we're in a dream, but only that there is no reason to suppose we are.

This leads one to ask, how could the Buddha know that nothing has svabhāva? And how can we know the Buddha was correct?

I, with my upbringing among Abrahamic religions, too quickly concluded that divine revelation would be required. You awakened me to the possibility knowledge through _direct perception_.

Eurus:: That's correct. The type of knowledge that the Buddhadharma aims for is _direct knowledge_; it's like knowing that the cake you ate on New Year's Eve is sweet because you tasted it. As such, this type of knowledge is devoid of uncertainty.

physics supports or refutes our current unphysics an insight into the nature of the mind. Furthermore, since we are in direct contact with the mind it is something that can be known directly. I'd like to learn more about this.
