Dijon:: Happy New Year!

Eurus:: Happy New Year! I hope our discussion leads to new ideas or new confidence in old ones.

Dijon:: I bought two translations of Nāgārjuna's _Mūlamadhyamakakārikā_, and read several chapters.

Eurus:: Which translations?

Dijon:: Garfield's and the joint translation by Siderits and Katsura.

Eurus:: What did you think?

Dijon:: It's dense.

Eurus:: It is. I believed it was meant to be accompanied and expanded upon by additional commentary. Nāgārjuna's verses are more like mnemonic outline of his thoughts than something to be understood on its own.

Dijon:: Siderits' mentioned this in his introduction. Given this is the case, it seems we should rely on the ancient commentators to decompress Nāgārjuna's meaning.  Yet Garfield sometimes seems more focused on his own ideas and interpretation.

This leads me to ask: am I reading to learn Nāgārjuna's views, or to learn the correct views? Like Garfield says, "who is to say that Nāgārjuna is the best possible interpreter of _Mūlamadhyamakakārikā_?" Maybe the ancient commentators misinterpret Nāgārjuna's views, yet they're more correct?

Eurus:: You're right to care more about knowing the correct views than knowing Nāgārjuna's views. One of the views, I think is correct, is the view that nothing has svabhāva---essence, inherent existence, or true identity.

Dijon:: In our previous discussion, we considered whether this position could be verified by examining the physical world. We found, to a remarkable degree, it can be. It seems that the universe is in some sense a single entangled and evolving wave function. Even particles, often thought of as fundamental, are just ways of talking about this wave function. Thus, only this wave function could have svabhāva. We didn't come to a consensus as to whether the consistent behavior of this wave function, which the laws of physics describe, can be called its svabhāva.

At this point, you reflected that any correspondence between the Madhyamaka Buddhist tenant that nothing has svabhāva, and physics, is coincidental. Since the tenant is a metaphysical claim about things-in-themselves, and since the methods of the physical science can't access things-in-themselves, physics is incapable of answering our question.

Eurus:: That's right. This can be illustrated by considering dreams: suppose that you performed the double slit experiment in a dream and the results coincided with our current understanding of quantum mechanics. Would the wave function from the dream have svabhāva?

Dijon:: My dreams operate inconsistently and bizarrely. Furthermore, everything in them dream originates from my own mind; the closest anything is to being new or independent of my mind would be simple super-positions of existing memories. In such a dream, the double slit experiment, and the knowledge of the wave function that I would infer from it, are reflections of the waking-life quantum mechanics.

Eurus:: What if the dream were perfectly realistic?

Dijon:: If the dream was perfectly realistic, it would operate consistently. Experiment would produce consistent results. There'd be fellow scientists in the dream, experimenting and writing papers. Unique and surprising events, not originating from my memories, would demonstrate to myself, in the dream, that the world of the dream is independent of my dream mind.

If "my" mind were capable of generating an entire consistent and independent dream world, then it seems like it may as well not be called "my" mind. It would be more like a computer simulation. Some people think our reality is like this---we are in a simulation or the "mind of God". Either could be true. Without revelation of some sort, there is no way for us to know for certain either way. Likewise, we couldn't know if the wave function has svabhāva.

This leads one to ask, how could Nāgārjuna know that nothing has svabhāva? And how can we know he's correct? I, with my upbringing among Abrahamic religions, too quickly concluded that divine revelation would be required. You awakened me to the possibility knowledge through _direct perception_.

When I read _Mūlamadhyamakakārikā_, it seems to me like he's trying to demonstrate it with reasoning from empirical observations. Yet, you're saying it's known through _direct perception_. You began explaining how this is possible, but I'd like to know more about it.

Eurus:: TODO: fill in answer; key ideas, direct perception provides certain knowledge.

TODO Discuss how direct perception stops the epistemological regress of knowing that you know. I.e., unlike our direct sensory observations here, which can be wrong like optical illusions, knowledge through direct perception stops the infinite epistemological regress.

Eurus:: That Buddhism's tenants come from direct perception, and not another authority, is a key distinction between Christianity and Buddhism.

Christians tenants get their authority from the ancient texts. Therefore, they must preserve and interpret these texts correctly. This textual source of authority leads to many difficulties. What texts are sacred? Have they been copied correctly? Are we interpreting their language correctly?

The Christian's unenviable situation is made worse because their eternal salvation depends on _faith_. Thus faith becomes the highest virtue. What is faith really, though? Growing up around contemporary Christian organizations, I was taught that faith means believing something blindly---

Dijon:: Must faith be _blind_? Christianity, like Buddhism, has many branches, and few encourage blind faith. I grew up attending a Lutheran church. Like Roman Catholics, they taught that faith should be buttressed by reason---

Eurus:: Blind or partially blind, faith is believing something with incomplete evidence. Salvation in Buddhism is through wisdom---knowledge, not faith. Prior to awakening, there will be doubt, because doubt is only eradicated through knowledge, not through faith.

Buddhists have faith too, but it doesn't save you; some tenants are unknowable prior to awakening. Other tenants are knowable prior to awakening, and these are gradually verified as one practices. As one reflects on the teachings of the Buddha, it becomes increasingly clear that he was extremely wise, and one's faith increases. This type of faith---the authentic kind, generated through contemplating and testing the teachings---is healthy. It commits one to the path. But there isn't any imperative of believe, even while practicing.

Dijon:: So a Buddhist's faith only matters to the extent that it produces action.

Eurus:: That's right. Furthermore, no faith will be required in the end, because everything can be verified directly.

Dijon:: Although Paul and Jesus didn't expand much on this, many Christians suspect God will answer their questions in heaven. So, in a way, Christian faith won't be required in the end either.

Eurus:: But faith was required to _get into_ heaven. You must believe Jesus was your savior, despite incomplete evidence, to be saved. This isn't the case for the Buddhist.

Dijon:: Your distinction may be less meaningful than it seems. Imagine a child who is born the same year as the Buddha, in classical Greece. His father sacrifices goats to Zeus. His mother hums hymns to Hera. Their polis holds parades and competitions for the gods. He knows none of the noble truths. The child dies and is reincarnated in Persian Egypt. And then in the Zhou dynasty in China. And on and on.

Occasionally they child is born in a Buddhist country. They donate to the sangha and participate in their town's rituals, but they are busy farming.

The child is born in a Christian country. Their parents are Christian. Their friends are nominally Christian. They read about Buddhism, but it seems odd. They equate nirvana with non-existence. "It's so pessimistic and life-denying." The child grows old and dies. And on and on. Why are you laughing?

Eurus:: I'm laughing because detail the ancient Greek and American reincarnations more than the eastern ones.

Dijon:: It's true, I know the most about what is in front of me and of what I've chosen to read about. I couldn't say what the Buddhist's rituals would be!

Eurus:: Sorry to interrupt, please continue.

Dijon:: So what happens if Buddhism goes extinct, like it largely has in it's homeland, but our child still hasn't stepped down the Buddhist path? Isn't the child's lack of faith preventing their salvation?

Eurus:: If Buddhism as we know it goes extinct, it will only re-emerge again. Three millennia is not very long. "How long is an eon," a monk once asked the Buddha? He says it's not easy to count, but he gives him a simile instead: "Suppose, monk, there was a great stone mountain a _yojana_ long, a _yojana_ wide, and a _yojana_ high, without holes ore crevices, one sold mass of rock. At the end of every hundred years a man would stroke it once with a piece of fine cloth. That great stone mountain might by this effort be worn away and eliminated but the eon would still not come to an end."

Yet even if this child is stuck in circles forever, what of it? The universe is the way it is. We are fortunate that there is such a thing as Nirvana and that there is a noble eightfold path to reach it.

My problem with Christianity isn't that some are damned but that some are damned by an all-loving God based on their beliefs about something that can't be known for certain. Dead Greek and Chinese children pose an inconsistency problem for Christianity, not Buddhism.

Dijon:: I've been playing the devil's advocate, but I agree with you. Salvation by faith is my biggest objection to protestantism and Christianity in general. 

I imagine walking along a narrow draw bridge made of fluffy clouds, naked. The sun is bright but not oppressive and the sky is pleasantly blue. I reach the other side, and there is a white gate. I plead with the man there, who says I can't enter: "I wanted to believe! I wanted to believe in an all-loving God who cares about me. I wanted to believe in this beautiful place. I'm glad it exists! Please let me enter. I want to meet God and talk to my grandparents. I studied the bible carefully. I examined the historical evidence as best I could. They didn't seem convincing. I looked for miracles and other assurances, but found nothing. After moving on from Christianity, I searched for the good life as best as I could, although it was beyond a haze. I made bad choices along the way. Sometimes I did what I know I shouldn't, maybe even because I didn't believe. Please! I don't even need answers, just please don't send me to hell!" I imagine this.

So I agree: Buddhist _faith_ seems less problematic than Christian faith.

Earlier you contrasted Christianity and Buddhism, saying Christian tenant's get their authority from the Bible. I presume Buddhism's tenants do _not_ get their authority from it's texts.

Eurus:: That's right. I don't want to imply that Buddhist scriptures and traditions are unimportant. While Buddhism has a vast literature, the real teaching of the Buddha is realization itself. That realization has been passed down to the present day through a multitude of monastic communities. Therefore the noble Saṃgha is effectively a direct connection to the Buddha himself. Some disciples in these communities have had the same realization as the Buddha did---at least in regards to being liberated from saṃsāra.

In Christianity, on the other hand, nobody after Jesus shared his realization, nor is that even possible, because we are not God and we never will be. There is no living embodiment of Christ's wisdom, so all we have to guide us are the written words.

Dijon:: So, despite the importance of the texts and traditions, Buddhism's tenants get their authority from direct perception.

Eurus:: Correct.

Dijon:: If all of the tenants of Buddhism can be verified by direct perception, then what aspects of the Buddha's realization are different from his disciples?

Eurus:: TODO fill in answer.

Dijon:: Your comments make me think about the Roman Catholic church. Their popes form a direct connection to Jesus, beginning with Peter. The authority of their tenants originate in the teachings of Jesus, and the ancient texts. However, the popes are thought to be guided by God---to be the living embodiment of Christ's wisdom and a means to provide the proper interpretation of the texts. Their Nāgārjuna, Thomas Aquinas, thought all their teachings could be verified with reason, except five: the creation of the world out of nothing, the Trinity, the incarnation, the sacraments, and eternal life.

Eurus:: I'm not too familiar with Roman Catholicism, so some of my earlier comments may not apply as well to them. However, the essential epistemological difference between Christianity and Buddhism remains: the individual can _directly verify_ reincarnation, law of karma, and the four noble truths once they are far enough down the path. As you said, the individual can not directly verify some central Christian beliefs. That is, unless they are fortunate enough to be given a private revelation from God.

Dijon:: You're right, this is an essential difference. Since the supreme Buddhist authority is _direct verification_ of its tenants, then why does the unbroken connection back to the Buddha matter? Couldn't someone verify these beliefs on their own?

Eurus:: Few find the path without guidance. Thus, the unbroken connection matters because there are still living individuals who've walked the path Buddha did and can lead the next generation down it. Buddhism will die out, but in another eon the path will be found again and the cycle will continue.

Dijon:: So protestantism has texts, Catholicism has the pope's interpretation of texts, Buddhism has _direct verification_, and science has experimentation.

If Buddhism, like science, provides a means to directly verify its tenants, wouldn't you expect it to remain uniform? Protestantism, because texts can be interpreted many ways, is a great tree. Large branches like Lutheranism divide into smaller ones. On the other hand, science begins with division, but joins together as repeatable experimentation produces a consensus. 

Eurus:: TODO fill in answer

TODO: ask whether, given the infallibility of direct perception, how there can be mistakes in the teachings. Dalai lama quote:

> This means that, in the Buddhist investigation of reality, at least in principle, empirical evidence should triumph over scriptural authority, no matter how deeply venerated a scripture may be. Even in the case of knowledge derived through reason or inference, its validity must derive ultimately from some observed facts of experience. Because of this methodological standpoint, I have often remarked to my Buddhist colleagues that the empirically verified insights of modern cosmology and astronomy must compel us now to modify, or in some cases reject, many aspects of traditional cosmology as found in ancient Buddhist texts.
