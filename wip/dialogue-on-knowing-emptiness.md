Eurus:: Happy New Year!

Dijon:: Happy New Year! I hope our discussion leads to new ideas or new confidence in old ones. At the end of our last conversation, you said śūnyatā is an insight into the nature of the mind. Furthermore, since we are in direct contact with the mind it is something that can be known directly. I'd like to learn more about this.

Eurus:: Suppose that you were dreaming, and in the dream, you performed the double slit experiment, and the results coincided with our current understanding of quantum mechanics. Does the wave function from the dream _fundamentally exists_ in your sense of the term? If not, why? If so, do you believe that there is a meaningful distinction between dream quantum mechanics and waking-life quantum mechanics, and could this distinction ever be known?

Dijon:: I do think the wave function in the dream fundamentally exists.

My dreams operate inconsistently and bizarrely. Furthermore, everything in them dream originates from my own mind; the closest anything is to being new or independent of my mind would be simple super-positions of existing memories. In such a dream, the double slit experiment, and the knowledge of the wave function that I would infer from it, are reflections of the waking-life quantum mechanics. Even in waking life we don't ever know the existence of the wave function directly; we only know of it through our memories of sense-data produced from reading and experiments. The dream of the double slit experiment would be like a memory of the waking-life double slit experiment, and therefore the dream wave-function is a reflection of the real-life wave function which does fundamentally exist.

Eurus:: What if the dream were realistic?

Dijon:: If a dream world were realistic, it would operate consistently. The double slit experiment would produce consistent results. Perhaps there are fellow scientists in the dream, experimenting and writing papers. Unique and surprising events, not originating from my memories, would demonstrate to myself, in the dream, that the world of the dream is independent of my dream mind. Thus, it would not be possible to distinguish dream quantum mechanics from waking-life quantum mechanics.

I think the second dream's wave function fundamentally exists, but for different reasons. The fact that the wave function was produced by my mind has now become an inaccessible metaphysical implementation detail; I would have no way of knowing about it, unless they were somehow revealed to me, say when I woke up.

If "my" mind were capable of generating an entire consistent and independent dream world, then it seems like it may as well not be called "my" mind. It would be more like a computer simulation. Some people think our reality is like this---we are in a simulation or the "mind of God". Either could be true. Without revelation of some sort, there is no way for us to know for certain either way.

Eurus:: Your answer highlights why your definition of _fundamentally exist_ is unsatisfactory. By defining it to always be meaningful to the scientist you've made it apply to dream wave functions. Realizing śūnyatā, or emptiness, is like waking up from such a dream.

Dijon:: I'm not denying that it's _possible_ we're in a dream, but only that there is no reason to suppose we are.
