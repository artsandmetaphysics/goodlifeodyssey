  Notes on English Poetry
---

- _Meter_ is the basic rhythmic structure of a line.
- In English, the meter is usually determined by the patter of stressed syllables.
- A _syllable_ is the phonological building blocks of words.
- Syllables usually have one vowel and zero or more consonants. E.g., "ee", "bee", or "bees".
- A _foot_ is a combination of stressed and unstressed syllables.
- Stressed syllables are often denoted by a line. (Imagine a taught string.)
- Unstressed syllables are often denoted by a little "u". (Imagine a relaxed string.)
- An iamb goes ˘¯.
- An trochee goes ¯˘.
- A dactyl goes ¯˘˘.
- An anapest ˘˘¯.
- There are names for most combinations, but these are the most common. Here are a few more:
- An pyrrhic goes ˘˘.
- An spondee goes ¯¯.
- English meter is usually described as a sequence of feet.
- Shakespeare and Milton wrote most often in iambic pentameter whose lines usually have five iambs.
