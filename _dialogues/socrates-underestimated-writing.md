  An imaginative dialogue with Socrates about the limitations of writing and dialectic.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> Excuse me. I am on my way through Athens. I saw this stream and, being a hot afternoon, decided to leave the path and walk along its banks. As I approached this tall tree, the faint echoes of your voices rose above the cicadas. You were so busy with your intercourse that you didn’t hear me. And so I’ve been standing here, leaning against this tree, listening for some time. Part of me wanted to interrupt, but part of me couldn’t pull away. Then, just now, you said something I couldn’t bear.

<span class="sc">Socrates:</span> What was so unbearable that you had to interrupt our dialogue with this speech of your own?

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> You said the written word can only remind us of what we already know. If you were attacked unfairly, wouldn’t it be just for your pupils to come to your aid? Likewise, I must come to the aid of my greatest teacher—the written word. It has taught me most of what I know.

<span class="sc">Socrates:</span> I shall try to explain. Writing shares a strange feature with painting. Paintings stand there as if they are alive, but if anyone asks them anything, they remain most solemnly silent. The same is true of written words. You’d think they were speaking as if they had some understanding, but if you question anything that has been said because you want to learn more, it continues to signify just that very same thing forever. And when it is faulted and attacked unfairly, it always needs its father’s support; alone, it can neither defend itself nor come to its own support.

Therefore, if you read and understand written words, then you already had the knowledge needed to understand them. If you read and don’t understand written words, you will have nobody to question. Therefore, written words can only remind us of what we already know.

<span class="sc">Phaedrus:</span> Well said. You are absolutely right about this.

<span class="sc">Socrates:</span> We need a more capable discourse, one that is written down, with knowledge, in the soul of the listener. We need a discourse that can defend itself.

<span class="sc">Phaedrus:</span> You mean the living, breathing discourse of the man who knows, of which the written one can be fairly called an image.

<span class="sc">Socrates:</span> That’s absolutely right. The dialectician chooses a proper soul and plants and sows within it discourse accompanied by knowledge—discourse capable of helping itself as well as the man who planted it, which is not barren but produces a seed from which more discourse grows in the character of others. Such discourse makes the seed forever immortal and renders the man who has it as happy as any human can be.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> Well, this is what _I’ve_ read. Among the ancient scribes of Egypt, there is one who wrote the following:

“As for those wise writers from the time after the gods, they who foretold what was to come, their names have become everlasting, even though they have departed this life and all their relatives are forgotten.

“They gave themselves a book as their lector-priest, a writing-board as their dutiful son. Teachings are their mausoleu, the reed-pen their child, the burnishing-stone their wife. Both great and small are given them as their children, for the writing is chief.

“Be a writer, take it to heart, so that _your_ name will fare likewise. A book is more effective than a carved tombstone or a permanent sepulcher. They serve as chapels and mausoleu in the mind of him who proclaims their names. A name on people’s lips will surely be effective in the afterlife!

“Is there one here like Hordedef? Is there another like Imhotep? None of our kin is like Neferti or Khety, their leader. May I remind you about Ptahemdjehuty and Khakheperraseneb! Is there another like Ptahhotep, or the equal of Kairsu?

“Those wise men who foretold what was to come: what they said came into being; it is found as a maxim, written in their books. Other’s offspring will be their heirs, as if they were their own children. They hid their magic from the world, but it is read in their teachings. They are gone, their names forgotten; but writings cause them to be remembered.”

<span class="sc">Phaedrus:</span> Do you really believe an ancient scribe wrote this?

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> I do believe it, because scholars from my land dug up the papyrus this was written on, and many like it, in the desert sands and learned how to read them. And so, having relayed this ancient account, I’d like to question your older companion: Why would the scribe praise Hordedef, Imhotep, Neferti, Khety, Ptahemdjehuty, Khakheperraseneb, Ptahhotep, and Kairsu if their writings merely reminded him of what he already knew?

<span class="sc">Socrates:</span> The teachings of these ancient wise men and prophets were planted in the souls of their contemporaries, where they grew like reeds until they covered the banks of the Nile. As the great river flooded and receded, and as pharaohs conquered and were conquered, these reeds swayed back and forth in the muddy waters. And so, this scribe’s mother, father, and grandmother planted the meaning of these sayings in his soul long before he could read “Hordedef” or “Ptahhotep.”

In fact, I guess that many of the sayings attributed to these wise men were not their own; forgotten writers used these great names as as sort of fertilizer for their own reeds.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> I see that I have not convinced you. Imagine that this scribe is struck deaf and dumb by Ammon for attributing immortality to the written word. He dies, and in the afterlife, he meets the sage Ptahhotep. He writes a note on a piece of papyrus:

“Vizier Ptahhotep, I prostrate myself before you, my superior. I have read your many teachings and taught them to my sons. As you know, they are on the lips of all lovers of wisdom in Egypt. Most of your sayings I could understand on my own, however, all my life I have had a question about one of them that nobody has been able to answer to my satisfaction. I can not speak or hear, but if you deemed to write responses on this papyrus, I would be honored and delighted to know your answer.”

The vizier, Ptahhotep, writes: “I will answer.”

Our deaf and dumb scribe bows very low, and without lifting his head, he writes:

“Your thirty-first maxim says:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Do not have sex with a boy</p>
<p>when you know that what is condemned will satisfy his desire.</p>
<p>There is no cooling his lust.</p>
<p>Let him not spend the night doing what is condemned:</p>
<p>he will cool down only after he has mastered his desire.</p>
</blockquote>

“This practice of older men having sex with boys is universally rejected in my time. Yet you speak against it as if it was common. This leads me to ask: does right and wrong change?”

He hands the papyrus to Ptahhotep, who fills the papyrus and places it on the ground in front of our scribe, whose head is still bowed. Our scribe begins reading. He reads of a middle path, explained to Ptahhotep by the gods of the underworld, that demonstrates how right and wrong changes in some ways but is fixed in other ways by the structure of the universe. Our scribe is so struck by the response that he doesn’t see Ptahhotep walk into the distance.

Our scribe reads the dialogue over and over again, studying its beautiful parts. But then he remembers Ammon’s chastisement, and having already memorized its contents, throws the papyrus back into the Styx, thus returning the reeds to where he’d harvested them.

Centuries after this meeting, a living man enters Hades, crosses the Styx, and asks Anubis to return his young wife to him. The man pleads and begs. He is a musician and plays a song that is overwhelmingly beautiful, that our Egyptian scribe, standing behind a crowd of bloodless onlookers, hears the soft melody and weeps for joy. Anubis relents, on one condition: “Do not look back,” he says, “or your wife will need to remain in the underworld.”

It just so happens that our scribe is sent to retrieve the man’s wife. He finds her and gives her two papyri. The first reads: “Your husband has sought you out from the chambers of death. He has overwhelmed Annubis with a song; your fate will be woven again. I was sent to bring you to him. I’ve given you a second papyrus to take with you back to the mortal realm. It contains a great secret, which will make you and your husband live forever.” She takes the gift and is reunited with her husband.

The couple climbs up from the fog and darkness, but fate ordained that the secret of right and wrong would remain in Hades, and the musician can not help but look back upon the beautiful face of his wife. Woe is she! Woe is the musician! Woe is our scribe, who never repented from his love of writing!

Do you think, if this secret dialogue were smuggled to Thrace, that it would merely remind me of what I already know? Keep in mind that I’ve had the very same questions that our scribe asked Ptahhotep.

<span class="sc">Socrates:</span> I would like to ask whether your scholars dug up a scroll with this story, but you are the one asking me questions, and so I’ll keep the goal of our conversation in mind.

We yearn for an absolute moral standard—this is because our souls, in past lives, must have been given Ptahhotep’s secrets. In this sense, then, the dialogue only reminds you of secret knowledge deep in your soul. In a more immediate sense, the dialogue _would_ be teaching you something new. Thus, I concede that the written word can do more than remind you of what you already know. However, even if the written word can sow the seeds of knowledge, dialectic is still a more able farmer

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> Why do you say that?

<span class="sc">Socrates:</span> An author, unlike a living teacher, must anticipate all of your questions to answer them. Since this is impossible, a writer will always leave you with questions.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> Where I come from, written words are abundant: if you shout a question towards the heavens, Boreas, Zephyrus, Notus, and Eurus will bring you everything that’s been written about the question before an acorn can fall to the ground. Thus, for many questions, I can rely on the written word.

<span class="sc">Socrates:</span> I would travel through dense forests and over high mountains to live in such a place—you are blessed.

Even if the written word can sow abundantly, casting seeds is not enough to ensure they grow in another’s soul.

Stranger, I take it that you, like me, have read widely and that you’ve observed this pattern in yourself: old plants are difficult to uproot. They grow tall and choke out new plants with their shadows. It’s too easy to dismiss an author’s ideas before we fully grasp them. Dialectic can weed out your garden and make room for new seeds.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> I have observed this pattern in myself. It is difficult to overcome; you must know yourself and be committed to the truth.

Dialectic has other problems. First, you must find someone with new ideas who’ll talk with you. Many people are too busy. Others have the time but find the questioning to be tedious. Still others will merely agree with what you already think. This last sort is especially dangerous because you’ll both continue onward in mutual ignorance, having watered each other’s plants.

Once you’ve found someone to talk with, there are other traps to avoid. Some people may be dishonest to avoid an argument. For example, a lover may not correct his beloved for fear of pushing them away. Other people become eager to win instead of investigating the subject under discussion. In fact, in the end, some have a most shameful parting of the ways, abuse heaped upon them.

<span class="sc">Socrates:</span> I’ve experienced this problem in many discussions. You are indeed correct. In fact, if you caught me on the right day, I may have spoken this very sentence.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> I think we should take a middle path. Use dialectic to weed your garden and the written word to sow new seeds and water the plants. Both methods require a commitment to finding the truth to be effective.

<span class="sc">Socrates:</span> By Theuth, you’re right—it’s best not to love one or the other too much.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> I must be off.

<span class="sc">Socrates:</span> Good day, enjoy your time in Athens.
