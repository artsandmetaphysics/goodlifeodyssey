<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> If you know Christianity is true, wouldn’t you want it established by congress as the state religion?

<span class="sc">Aaron:</span> No—even if _you_ know it’s true, other citizens may disagree.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> But they’d be mistaken, right? Some kooks believe the moon-landing was made up, but that doesn’t mean our textbooks should equivocate on the matter.

<span class="sc">Aaron:</span> Sure. There are always suspicious and uneducated people with their opinions. But religion is more important than some footprints on the moon.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> If it’s more important, wouldn’t that also make it more important to establish?

<span class="sc">Aaron:</span> Even if I’m certain that Christianity is true, I wouldn’t want to force it on others. Good wants true believers. I couldn’t prove my faith to you.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> If you can’t prove your faith to me, then how do _you_ know its true?

<span class="sc">Aaron:</span> It’s an internal experience—I’ve felt God’s presence. I can’t explain it with words.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> Then it’s even more important to establish Christianity as the state religion! Your privileged knowledge can save others from damnation. Certainly God wants true believers, but you wouldn’t have to use a heavy hand. Don’t persecute Buddhists or Muslims, just help Christians: give churches stipends for missionaries, require Bible reading in the schools, and don’t let movie directors misrepresent your beliefs. You can’t force someone to have faith, but you can certainly make it easier for people to believe by keeping it mainstream.

<span class="sc">Aaron:</span> A moderate Christian state may be appealing, but once in power, the Christian leaders would inevitably fall into sin. They may rule beneficently for a while, but if their power was justified with religious beliefs, before long they’d persecute non-believers to preserve their power.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> You’re probably right, but it could be worthwhile if you could saved enough souls before it fell apart. Medieval Europeans didn’t enjoy natural rights, but think of all the peasants that were saved! Christianity has been waning since the Enlightenment gave us liberty and equality. Maybe it was a poor trade?

<span class="sc">Aaron:</span> Perhaps, but Americans won’t give up their religions freedom.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> It’s only a thought experiment—

<span class="sc">Aaron:</span> Besides, Christianity isn’t homogeneous. I know Jesus died for my sins, but I’m much less confident that infants need to be baptised. Who would regulate these smaller disagreements?

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> That’s a good point; I suspect the first amendment was meant to protect Puritans from Anglicans more than Buddhists from Christians. I worry that if religion is relegated to the realm of opinion, all morality will be too—corroding our country.

<span class="sc">Aaron:</span> I believe there exists an absolutely correct moral standard, but I am not confident what it is. Prostituting children is usually wrong but evading taxes may be debatable, especially if you’re poor. Similarly, I may believe that there is one true religion, while not being entirely certain that I found it.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> I thought you said you _know_ Christianity is true?

<span class="sc">Aaron:</span> I do, but I’m not confident enough to establish it as the state religion.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> You only need to be more certain than the alternatives. Act proportionally to reason! Are you believe in our Constitution more than Christianity?

<span class="sc">Aaron:</span> This is a false dilemma! You’re oversimplifying.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> I am! There isn’t enough time to undersimplify. Elanor woke up, so I better go!

<span class="sc">Aaron:</span> Enjoy your Sunday!
