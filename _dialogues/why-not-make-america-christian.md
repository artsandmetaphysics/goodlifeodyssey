<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> If you know Christianity is true, wouldn’t you want it established by congress?

<span class="sc">Aaron:</span> No—even if _you_ know it’s true, other citizens may disagree.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> But they’d be mistaken, right? Some kooks believe the moon-landing was made up, but that doesn’t mean our textbooks should equivocate on the matter.

<span class="sc">Aaron:</span> Sure. There are always suspicious and uneducated people with their opinions. But religion is more important.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> If it’s more important, wouldn’t that also make it more important to establish?

<span class="sc">Aaron:</span> Even if I’m certain that Christianity is true, I wouldn’t want to force it on others. I couldn’t prove my faith to you.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> If you can’t prove your faith to me, then how do _you_ know its true?

<span class="sc">Aaron:</span> It’s an internal experience—I’ve felt God’s presence. I can’t explain it with words.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> Then it’s even more important to establish Christianity as the state religion! Your privileged knowledge can save others from damnation. You wouldn’t have to use a heavy hand. Don’t persecute Buddhists or Muslims, which would be wrong. Just help Christians: give churches stipends for missionaries, require Bible reading in the schools, and don’t let movie directors grossly misrepresent your beliefs. You can’t force someone to have faith, but you can certainly make it easier for people to believe by keeping it mainstream.

<span class="sc">Aaron:</span> A moderate Christian state may be appealing, but once in power, the Christian leaders would inevitably fall into sin. They may rule beneficently for a while, but if their power was justified with religious beliefs, before long they’d persecute non-believers to preserve their power.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> You’re probably right, but it could be worthwhile if you could saved enough souls before it fell apart. Medieval Europeans didn’t enjoy natural rights, but think of the great masses that were saved! Christianity has been waning since the Enlightenment gave us liberty and equality. Maybe it was a poor trade?

<span class="sc">Aaron:</span> Perhaps, but Americans won’t give up their religions freedom.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> It’s only a thought experiment—

<span class="sc">Aaron:</span> Besides, Christianity isn’t homogeneous. I know Jesus died for my sins, but I’m much less confident that infants need to be baptised.
