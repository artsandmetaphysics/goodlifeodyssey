      <h1>“The Homeric Hymns”</h1>
      <p><em>The Homeric Hymns</em> are a collection of thirty-three hexameter poems which honor the ancient Greek gods. Modern scholars believe most of them were written between 700 and 500 BCE. The hymns were traditionally attributed to Homer.</p>
      <p>The Hymns vary from three to over five-hundred lines. Here are the longest and most interesting hymns:</p>
      <ol>
        <li value="2">Hymn to Demeter, Persephone and the origin of winter</li>
        <li value="3">Hymn to Apollo, how his temples came about</li>
        <li value="4">Hymn to Hermes, his birth and theft of Apollo’s cows</li>
        <li value="5">Hymn to Aphrodite, affair with mortal Anchises</li>
        <li value="7">Hymn to Dionysus, pirates and dolphins</li>
        <li value="19">Hymn to Pan, his domains and dances</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The hymns appear to be used as preludes at poetry competitions or ceremonies.</p>
      <p>All of the quotes here are from the H.G. Evelyn-White translation, and the line numbers are approximate.</p>
      <p>A central theme in the hymns, as in <em>The Theogony</em>, is the birth of the gods. They seem especially interested in the location of the birth:</p>
      <blockquote><p>
      For some say, at Dracanum; and some, on windy Icarus; and some, in
      Naxos, O Heaven-born, Insewn; and others by the deep-eddying river
      Alpheus that pregnant Semele bare you to Zeus the thunder-lover. And
      others yet, lord, say you were born in Thebes; but all these lie. The
      Father of men and gods gave you birth remote from men and secretly from
      white-armed Hera.
      </p></blockquote>

      <blockquote><p>
      Rejoice, blessed Leto, for you bare glorious children, the lord Apollo
      and Artemis who delights in arrows; her in Ortygia, and him in rocky
      Delos, as you rested against the great mass of the Cynthian hill hard by
      a palm-tree by the streams of Inopus.
      </p></blockquote>

      <blockquote><p>
      I will sing of Heracles, the son of Zeus and much the mightiest of men
      on earth. Alcmena bare him in Thebes, the city of lovely dances, when
      the dark-clouded Son of Cronos had lain with her.
      </p></blockquote>

      <p>Another theme is the relationship between gods and men:</p>
      <blockquote><p>
      Thence, swift as thought, he [Apollo] speeds from earth to Olympus, to
      the house of Zeus, to join the gathering of the other gods: then
      straightway the undying gods think only of the lyre and song, and all
      the Muses together, voice sweetly answering voice, hymn the unending
      gifts the gods enjoy and the sufferings of men, all that they endure at
      the hands of the deathless gods, and how they live witless and helpless
      and cannot find healing for death or defense against old age.
      </p></blockquote>

      <blockquote><p>
      Sing, clear-voiced Muses, of Hephaestus famed for inventions. With
      bright-eyed Athene he taught men glorious gifts throughout the world, —
      men who before used to dwell in caves in the mountains like wild beasts.
      But now that they have learned crafts through Hephaestus the famed
      worker, easily they live a peaceful life in their own houses the whole
      year round.
      </p></blockquote>

      <blockquote><p>
      And now because of you [Anchilles] I [Aphrodite] shall have great shame
      among the deathless gods henceforth, continually. For until now they
      feared my jibes and the wiles by which, or soon or late, I mated all the
      immortals with mortal women, making them all subject to my will. But now
      my mouth shall no more have this power among the gods; for very great
      has been my madness, my miserable and dreadful madness, and I went
      astray out of my mind who have gotten a child beneath my girdle, mating
      with a mortal man.
      </p></blockquote>

      <p>The Hymn to Demeter describes the Eleusian mysteries:</p>
      <blockquote><p>
      Then she [Demeter] went, and to the kings who deal justice, Triptolemus
      and Diocles, the horse-driver, and to doughty Eumolpus and Celeus,
      leader of the people, she showed the conduct of her rites and taught
      them all her mysteries, to Triptolemus and Polyxeinus and Diocles also,
      — awful mysteries which no one may in any way transgress or pry into or
      utter, for deep awe of the gods checks the voice. Happy is he among men
      upon earth who has seen these mysteries; but he who is uninitiate and
      who has no part in them, never has lot of like good things once he is
      dead, down in the darkness and gloom.
      </p></blockquote>

      <p>The Hymn to Gaia is beautiful:</p>
      <blockquote><p>
      I will sing of well-founded Earth, mother of all, eldest of all beings.
      She feeds all creatures that are in the world, all that go upon the
      goodly land, and all that are in the paths of the seas, and all that
      fly: all these are fed of her store. Through you, O queen, men are
      blessed in their children and blessed in their harvests, and to you it
      belongs to give means of life to mortal men and to take it away. Happy
      is the man whom you delight to honor! He has all things abundantly: his
      fruitful land is laden with corn, his pastures are covered with cattle,
      and his house is filled with good things. Such men rule orderly in their
      cities of fair women: great riches and wealth follow them: their sons
      exult with ever-fresh delight, and their daughters in flower-laden bands
      play and skip merrily over the soft flowers of the field. Thus is it
      with those whom you honor O holy goddess, bountiful spirit.
      </p></blockquote>

      <p>There are a handful of similes. Here is one which I particularly enjoyed:</p>
      <blockquote><p>
      As a swift thought darts through the heart of a man when thronging cares
      haunt him, or as bright glances flash from the eye, so glorious Hermes
      planned both thought and deed at once.
      </p></blockquote>
