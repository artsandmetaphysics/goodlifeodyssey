      <h1>Sophocles’ Theban Plays</h1>
      <h2 id="oedipus-the-king">Oedipus the King</h2>
      <p>Angered Tiresias implicates Oedipus:</p>
      <blockquote><p>
      So, you mock my blindness? Let me tell you this.<br />
      You with your precious eyes,<br />
      you're blind to the corruption of your life,<br />
      to the house you live in, those you live with—<br />
      who are your parents? Do you know? All unknowing<br />
      you are the scourge of your own flesh and blood,<br />
      the dead below the earth and the living here above,<br />
      and the double lash of your mother and your father's curse<br />
      will whip you from this land one day, their footfall<br />
      treading you down in terror, darkness shrouding<br />
      your eyes that can see the light!
      </p></blockquote>

      <p>The following quotations expresses two ideas central to the Greek world view. First, that the gods strip down the over-proud man, the man filled with hubris. Second, that we competition is healthy.</p>
      <blockquote><p>
      Destiny guide me always<br />
      Destiny guide me filled with reverence<br />
      pure in word and deed.<br />
      Great laws tower above us, reared on high<br />
      born for the brilliant vault of heaven—<br />
      Olympian Sky their only father,<br />
      nothing mortal, no man gave them birth,<br />
      their memory deathless, never lost in sleep:<br />
      within them lives a mighty god, the god does not<br />
      grow old. Pride breeds the tyrant<br />
      violent pride, gorging, crammed to bursting<br />
      with all that is overripe and rich with ruin—<br />
      clawing up to the heights, headlong pride<br />
      crashes down the abyss—sheer doom!<br />
      No footing helps, all foothold lost and gone.<br />
      But the healthy strife that makes the city strong—<br />
      I pray that god will never end that wrestling:<br />
      god, my champion, I will never let you go.
      </p></blockquote>

      <p>These two ideas are present in many of the ancient Greek works; Hesiod, near the opening of <em>Works and Days</em>, speaks of strife that causes men to compete with one another, doing people good; Herodotus' stories highlight his belief that the gods tore down over-proud men—he also explicitly discusses this idea; the <em>Iliad</em> is filled with proud men striving with one other to "be the best."</p>
      <p>The Chorus, after Oedipus is revealed:</p>
      <blockquote><p>
      O the generations of men<br />
      the dying generations—adding the total<br />
      of all your lives I find they come to nothing...<br />
      does there exist, is there a man on earth<br />
      who seizes more joy than just a dream, a vision?<br />
      And the vision no sooner dawns than dies<br />
      blazing into oblivion.<br />
      You are my great example, you, your life<br />
      your destiny, Oedipus, man of misery—<br />
      I count no man blest.
      </p></blockquote>

      <p>Oedipus, chases after his wife and mother Jocasta:</p>
      <blockquote><p>
      His wife,<br />
      no wife, his mother, where can eh find the mother earth<br />
      that cropped two crops at once, himself and all his children?<br />
      He was raging—one of the dark powers pointing the way,<br />
      with a great shattering cry—someone, something leading him on—<br />
      he hurled at the twin doors and bending the bolts back<br />
      out of their sockets, crashed through the chamber.<br />
      And there we saw the woman hanging by the neck,<br />
      cradled high in a woven noose, spinning,<br />
      swinging back and forth. And when he saw her,<br />
      giving a low, wrenching sob that broke our hearts,<br />
      slipped the halter from her throat, he eased her down,<br />
      in a slow embrace he laid her down, poor thing...<br />
      then, what came next, what horror we beheld!<br />
      He rips off her brooches, the long gold pins<br />
      holding her robes—and lifting them high,<br />
      looking straight up into the points,<br />
      he digs them down the sockets of his eyes, crying, "You,<br />
      you'll see no more the pain I suffered, all the pain I caused!<br />
      Too long you looked on the ones you never should have seen,<br />
      blind to the ones you longed to see, to know! Blind<br />
      from this hour on! Blind in the darkness—blind!"<br />
      His voice like a dirge, rising, over and over<br />
      raising the pins, raking them down his eyes.<br />
      And at each stroke blood spurts from the roots,<br />
      splashing his beard, a swirl of it, nerves and clots—<br />
      black hail of blood pulsing, gushing down.
      </p></blockquote>

      <p>The Chorus, at the end of the play:</p>
      <blockquote><p>
      People of Thebes, my countrymen, look on Oedipus.<br />
      He solved the famous riddle with his brilliance,<br />
      he rose to power, a man beyond all power.<br />
      Who could behold his greatness without envy?<br />
      Now what a black sea of terror has overwhelmed him.<br />
      Now as we keep our watch and wait the final day,<br />
      count no many happy till he dies, free of pain at last.
      </p></blockquote>

      <p>This metric for judging the happy life is in Herodotus' fable of Solon meeting Croesus.</p>
      <h2 id="oedipus-at-colonus">Oedipus at Colonus</h2>
      <blockquote><p>
      Oh Theseus,<br />
      dear friend, only the gods can never age,<br />
      the gods can never die. All else in the world<br />
      almighty Time obliterates, crushes all<br />
      to nothing. The earth's strength wastes away,<br />
      the strength of a man's body wastes and dies—<br />
      faith dies, and bad faith comes to life,<br />
      and the same wind of friendship cannot blow forever,<br />
      holding steady and strong between two friends,<br />
      much less between two cities.<br />
      For some of us soon, for others later,<br />
      joy turns to hate and back again to love.<br />
      And even if all is summer sunshine now<br />
      between yourself and Thebes,<br />
      infinite Time, sweeping through its rounds<br />
      gives birth to infinite nights and days...<br />
      and a day will come when the treaties of an hour,<br />
      the pacts firmed by a handclasp will snap—<br />
      at the slightest word a spear will hurl them to the winds—<br />
      some far-off day when my dead body, slumbering, buried<br />
      cold in death, will drain their hot blood down,<br />
      if Zeus is still Zeus and Apollo the son of god<br />
      speaks clear and true.<br />
      ~ (685--707)
      </p></blockquote>

      <blockquote><p>
      Here, stranger,<br />
      here in the land of horses are a glory<br />
      you have reached the noblest home on earth<br />
      Colonus glistening, brilliant in the sun—<br />
      where the nightingale sings on,<br />
      her dying music rising clear,<br />
      hovering always, never learning,<br />
      down the shadows deepening green<br />
      she haunts the glades, the wine-dark ivy,<br />
      dense and dark the untrodden, sacred wood of god<br />
      rich with laurel and olives never touched by the sun<br />
      untouched by storms that blast from every quarter—<br />
      where the Reveler Dionysus strides the earth forever<br />
      where the wild nymphs are dancing round him<br />
      nymphs who nursed his life.<br />
      And here it blooms, fed by the dews of heaven<br />
      lovely, clustering, morning-fresh forever,<br />
      narcissus, crown of the Great Goddesss<br />
      Mother and Daughter dying<br />
      into life from the dawn of time,<br />
      and the gold crocus bursts like break of day<br />
      and the springs will never sleep, will never fail,<br />
      the fountainhead of Cephisus flowing nomad<br />
      quickening life forever, fresh each day—<br />
      life rising up with the river's pure tide<br />
      flowing over the plains, the swelling breast of earth—<br />
      nor can the dancing Muses bear to leave this land<br />
      or the Goddess Aphrodite, the charioteer<br />
      with the golden reins of love.<br />
      ~ (761--89)
      </p></blockquote>

      <blockquote><p>
      Suffer us to live here ... even in these straights<br />
      our life is not as pitiful as you'd think,<br />
      so long as we find joy in every hour.<br />
      ~ (909--11)
      </p></blockquote>

      <p>Oedipus declaring his innocence to Creon, in front of Theseus and the Athenians:</p>
      <blockquote><p>
      Unctuous, shameless—where do you think your insults<br />
      do more damage, my old age or yours? Bloodshed<br />
      incest, misery, all your mouth lets fly at me,<br />
      I have suffered it all, and all against my will!<br />
      Such was the pleasure of the gods, raging,<br />
      perhaps, against our race from ages past.<br />
      But as for me alone—<br />
      say my unwilling crimes against myself<br />
      and against my own were payment from the gods<br />
      for something criminal deep inside me...no, look hard,<br />
      you'll find no guilt to accuse me of—I am innocent!<br />
      ...<br />
      And my mother...<br />
      wretched man, have you no shame? Your own sister!<br />
      Her marriage—forcing me to talk of that marriage!<br />
      Oh I'll tell it all, I won't be silent, not now,<br />
      you and your blasphemous mouth have gone so far.<br />
      She was my mother, yes, she bore me—<br />
      oh the horror—I knew nothing, she knew nothing!—<br />
      and once she'd born me then she bore me children,<br />
      her disgrace. But at least I know one thing:<br />
      you slander her and me of your own free will,<br />
      but I made her my bride against my will,<br />
      I repeat this to the world against my will. No,<br />
      I'll not be branded guilty, not in that marriage,<br />
      not in the murder of my father, all those crimes<br />
      you heap on me relentlessly, harrowing my heart.<br />
      ~ (1095--1131)
