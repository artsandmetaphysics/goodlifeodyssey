<blockquote>
<p>It's a Friday evening,</p>
<p>dinner's not yet started.</p>
<p>Elanor is grinning,</p>
<p>prancing. Now she's stacking</p>
<p>wooden blocks, painted red,</p>
<p>purple, pink and yellow,</p>
<p>green and robin-egg blue.</p>
<p>Some make dominoes, while</p>
<p>others we spin and roll.</p>
<p>Wobbling, wobbling, wobbling---</p>
<p>they end with a crescendo.</p>
<p>"Mama", "dada", "uh-oh"---</p>
<p>little words that echo</p>
<p>through this small apartment,</p>
<p>along with pronouncements</p>
<p>only parents could decipher.</p>
<p>Next we scribble on New</p>
<p>Yorkers, coloring in</p>
<p>cartoons and white corners.</p>
<p>Then our one-year-old gets</p>
<p>jealous of the pen I'm</p>
<p>writing poems with. "No no."</p>
<p>Crayons scatter. Blocks bang.</p>
<p>Dinner preparations</p>
<p>begin and play time ends.</p>
</blockquote>
