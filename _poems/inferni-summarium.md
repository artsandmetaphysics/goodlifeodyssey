  Inferni Summarium

  A poetic summary of the first part of Dante’s _Divine Comedy_
---

Dante, astray in a dark wood, sees light,<br>
but leopard, lion, and wolf halts his way.<br>
Wise Virgil comes to guide him past his plight.<br>
<br>
The pilgrim, no Aeneas or Paul, stays.<br>
“Your Beatrice sent me, so have no fear—<br>
our path is sure, though through hell’s dark maze.”<br>
<br>
“Abandon every hope, who enter here,”<br>
declares the gate. Agnostics chase a flag,<br>
while unrepentant throng Acheron’s pier.<br>
<br>
Sorrow without torments for those who lag<br>
the saving cross—Homer, Plato, and so—<br>
though castle and greens uplift, their spirits sag.<br>
<br>
Shades confess, then Minos’ tail casts below.<br>
Tempests endlessly buffet the lusting.<br>
Our pilgrim faints for false Fransesca’s show.<br>
<br>
Overeaters bark in the cold, falling,<br>
foul, filth with the three-headed demon dog.<br>
A man foretells the white Guelphs ending.<br>
<br>
Hoarders and spendthrifts, in a circular slog,<br>
roll weights to and fro. The wrathful damned fight<br>
while the slothful’s bubbles cover the bog.<br>
<br>
Furies, halting our nervous pair, incite<br>
an angel to descend and clear the way,<br>
where heretics, crowded in tombs, alight.<br>
<br>
Proud Farinata rises to waylay<br>
the two, as they pass buried Epicures.<br>
Sad news, with dark prophecy, he repays.<br>
<br>
Adjusting to the stench, Virgil confers<br>
hell’s order: incontinence, violence,<br>
then fraud—with ever increasing tortures.<br>
<br>
Half-bull dismissed, they see a turbulent<br>
stream of boiling blood immersing tyrants<br>
and killers, watch’d by centaurs with bows bent.<br>
<br>
Self-killers turn into trees, who spout grunts<br>
and blood when snapped and someday will hang bodies.<br>
Nude squanderers flee, the prey of dog-hunts.<br>
<br>
A rain of fire justly rewards blasphemers<br>
in this sandy circle, crossed only via tears<br>
flowing from the Old Man’s diverse crevices.<br>
<br>
Dantes’ mentor, Ser Brunetto, appears—<br>
seeking fame though blackened. He foretells his<br>
pupils’ exile, who says he’ll persevere.<br>
<br>
Three Florentines encircle Dante: “‘tis<br>
true, courtesy and valour flew our state?”<br>
They left despondent. Then Geryon meets his summonses.<br>
<br>
A serpent, scorpion, man—instantiate<br>
fraud—carried them down to the eighth dark ring,<br>
passing lenders who’d used an unfair rate.<br>
<br>
The first of ten dikes is filled with marching<br>
pimps and seducers, whipped red. Jason’s there.<br>
Next, dipped in shit, are those damned for flatt’ring,<br>
<br>
then buried priests, flaming feet in the air,<br>
who pimped dear Jesus’ bride for gold.<br>
Indignant Dante calls the pope’s pain fair.<br>
<br>
The mages contort their necks, and behold<br>
there buttocks fore’er. Rejecting pity,<br>
our guide utters a story that’s scrambled.<br>
<br>
Corrupt officials boil in tar and flee<br>
from poking demons, who’d sooner harm than<br>
guide the two, if not for heaven holy.<br>
<br>
The escorts hook a tardy denizen<br>
of the pit, who’s questioned ‘between torment,<br>
escapes, leaving tarred captors. We’re free again.<br>
<br>
A sliding escape. The hypocrites, bent<br>
by painted lead cloaks, trudge o’re Pharisees.<br>
Two false fat friars direct their ascent.<br>
<br>
After the climb, and breathing break, armies<br>
of snakes emerge below—who bite, hand-cuff,<br>
and somehow ignite frantic naked thieves.<br>
<br>
One rebel’s neck is squeezed shut—“enough!”<br>
Two other’s flesh and bones are stolen when,<br>
wax-like, they meld with serpents, coiled rough.<br>
<br>
Hot flames entomb false counselors within.<br>
Ulysses’s friends, won by his words, end in<br>
a God-sent wave, having seen the mountain.<br>
<br>
The next flame asked how Italy has been—<br>
a soldier turned friar turned fraud who led<br>
pope Boni’s scheme to conquer Christian kin.<br>
<br>
Next, those who’ve pimped mistrust and schism bred<br>
are split and closed repeatedly. There lies<br>
Mohamed and a man holding his own head!<br>
<br>
An unavenged cousin’s curses occupies<br>
our pair’s descent into the final ditch,<br>
where plagued alchemists itch and smells paralyze,<br>
<br>
impersonators bite, and one who did switch<br>
real gold for dross bickers with a Greek liar.<br>
There Myrrah and Potiphar’s wife do twitch.<br>
<br>
Nearing the ninth circle, where chains inter<br>
the giants, dumb Nimrod blasts his horn.<br>
Anteus trades fame for gentle transfer.<br>
<br>
In Caïna, killers of kin adorn<br>
the ice and brothers ram heads endlessly.<br>
Betrayers of party face Dante’s scorn.<br>
<br>
Now Ugolino, stops gnawing Ruggieri<br>
to tell how his kids starved before his eyes.<br>
Betrayers of guests freeze with living bodies.<br>
<br>
Past Cassius, Brutus, Judas—who satisifies<br>
Satan’s three mouths—trudge our pair through hell’s core<br>
and up to see the stars and open skies.<br>
