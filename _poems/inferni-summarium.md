<blockquote>
<p>Dante, astray in a dark wood, sees light,</p>
<p>but leopard, lion, and wolf halts his way.</p>
<p>Wise Virgil comes to guide him past his plight.</p>
<p>The pilgrim, no Aeneas or Paul, stays.</p>
<p>"Your Beatrice sent me, so have no fear---</p>
<p>our path is sure, though through hell's dark maze."</p>
<p>"Abandon every hope, who enter here,"</p>
<p>declares the gate. Agnostics chase a flag,</p>
<p>while unrepentant throng Acheron's pier.</p>
<p>Sorrow without torments for those who lag</p>
<p>the saving cross---Homer, Plato, and so---</p>
<p>though castle and greens uplift, their spirits sag.</p>
<p>Shades confess, then Minos' tail casts below.</p>
<p>Tempests endlessly buffet the lusting.</p>
<p>Our pilgrim faints for false Fransesca's show.</p>
<p>Overeaters bark in the cold, falling,</p>
<p>foul, filth with the three-headed demon dog.</p>
<p>A man foretells the white Guelphs ending.</p>
<p>Hoarders and spendthrifts, in a circular slog,</p>
<p>roll weights to and fro. The wrathful damned fight</p>
<p>while the slothful's bubbles cover the bog.</p>
<p>Furies, halting our nervous pair, incite</p>
<p>an angel to descend and clear the way,</p>
<p>where heretics, crowded in tombs, alight.</p>
<p>Proud Farinata rises to waylay</p>
<p>the two, as they pass buried Epicures.</p>
<p>Sad news, with dark prophecy, he repays.</p>
<p>Adjusting to the stench, Virgil confers</p>
<p>hell's order: incontinence, violence,</p>
<p>then fraud---with ever increasing tortures.</p>
<p>Half-bull dismissed, they see a turbulent</p>
<p>stream of boiling blood immersing tyrants</p>
<p>and killers, watch'd by centaurs with bows bent.</p>
<p>Self-killers turn into trees, who spout grunts</p>
<p>and blood when snapped and someday will hang bodies.</p>
<p>Nude squanderers flee, the prey of dog-hunts.</p>
<p>A rain of fire justly rewards blasphemers</p>
<p>in this sandy circle, crossed only via tears</p>
<p>flowing from the Old Man's diverse crevices.</p>
<p>Dantes' mentor, Ser Brunetto, appears---</p>
<p>seeking fame though blackened. He foretells his</p>
<p>pupils' exile, who says he'll persevere.</p>
<p>Three Florentines encircle Dante: "'tis</p>
<p>true, courtesy and valor flew our state?"</p>
<p>They left despondent. Then Geryon meets his summonses.</p>
<p>A serpent, scorpion, man---instantiate</p>
<p>fraud---carried them down to the eighth dark ring,</p>
<p>passing lenders who'd used an unfair rate.</p>
<p>The first of ten dikes is filled with marching</p>
<p>pimps and seducers, whipped red. Jason's there.</p>
<p>Next, dipped in shit, are those damned for flatt'ring,</p>
<p>then buried priests, flaming feet in the air,</p>
<p>who pimped dear Jesus' bride for gold.</p>
<p>Indignant Dante calls the pope's pain fair.</p>
<p>The mages contort their necks, and behold</p>
<p>there buttocks fore'er. Rejecting pity,</p>
<p>our guide utters a story that's scrambled.</p>
<p>Corrupt officials boil in tar and flee</p>
<p>from poking demons, who'd sooner harm than</p>
<p>guide the two, if not for heaven holy.</p>
<p>The escorts hook a tardy denizen</p>
<p>of the pit, who's questioned 'between torment,</p>
<p>escapes, leaving tarred captors. We're free again.</p>
<p>A sliding escape. The hypocrites, bent</p>
<p>by painted lead cloaks, trudge o're Pharisees.</p>
<p>Two false fat friars direct their ascent.</p>
<p>After the climb, and breathing break, armies</p>
<p>of snakes emerge below---who bite, hand-cuff,</p>
<p>and somehow ignite frantic naked thieves.</p>
<p>One rebel's neck is squeezed shut---"enough!"</p>
<p>Two other's flesh and bones are stolen when,</p>
<p>wax-like, they meld with serpents, coiled rough.</p>
<p>Hot flames entomb false counselors within.</p>
<p>Ulysses's friends, won by his words, end in</p>
<p>a God-sent wave, having seen the mountain.</p>
<p>The next flame asked how Italy has been---</p>
<p>a soldier turned friar turned fraud who led</p>
<p>pope Boni's scheme to conquer Christian kin.</p>
<p>Next, those who've pimped mistrust and schism bred</p>
<p>are split and closed repeatedly. There lies</p>
<p>Mohamed and a man holding his own head!</p>
<p>An unavenged cousin's curses occupies</p>
<p>our pair's descent into the final ditch,</p>
<p>where plagued alchemists itch and smells paralyze,</p>
<p>impersonators bite, and one who did switch</p>
<p>real gold for dross bickers with a Greek liar.</p>
<p>There, Myrrah and Potiphar's wife do twitch.</p>
<p>Nearing the ninth circle, where chains inter</p>
<p>the giants, dumb Nimrod blasts his horn.</p>
<p>Anteus trades fame for gentle transfer.</p>
<p>In Ca√Øna, killers of kin adorn</p>
<p>the ice and brothers ram heads endlessly.</p>
<p>Betrayers of party face Dante's scorn.</p>
<p>Now Ugolino, stops gnawing Ruggieri</p>
<p>to tell how his kids starved before his eyes.</p>
<p>Betrayers of guests freeze with living bodies.</p>
<p>Past Cassius, Brutus, Judas---who satisfies</p>
<p>Satan's three mouths---trudge our pair through hell's core</p>
<p>and up to see the stars and open skies.</p>
