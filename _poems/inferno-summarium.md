  A poetic summary of the first part of Dante’s _Divine Comedy_

*Dark Wood*<br>
Dante, astray in a dark wood, sees light.<br>
Since leopard, lion, and wolf halt our ways,<br>
wise Virgil comes to guide us past our plight.<br>
<br>
*Dark Wood*<br>
The pilgrim, no Aeneas or Paul, stays.<br>
“Your Beatrice sent me, so have no fear—<br>
our path is sure, though into hell’s deep maze.”<br>
<br>
*Ante-Inferno*<br>
“Abandon every hope, who enter here,”<br>
declares the gate. Agnostics chase a flag,<br>
while unrepentant throng Acheron’s pier.<br>
<br>
*Circle I: Limbo*<br>
Sorrow without torments for those who lag<br>
the saving cross—Homer, Plato, and so.<br>
Castle and green uplifts though spirits sag.<br>
<br>
*Circle II: Lust*<br>
Shades confess, then Minos’ tail casts below.<br>
Tempests endlessly buffet the lusting.<br>
Our pilgrim faints for false Fransesca’s show.<br>
<br>
*Circle III: Gluttonous*<br>
Overeaters bark in the cold, falling,<br>
foul, filfth with the three-headed demon dog.<br>
A man foretells of the white Guelphs ending.<br>
<br>
*Circle IV: Spendthrifts and Prodigals*<br>
*Circle V: Wrathful and Slothful*<br>
Hoarders and spendthrifts, in a circular slog,<br>
roll weights to and fro. The wrathful damn’d fight<br>
while the slothful’s bubbles cover the bog.<br>
<br>
*The Gate of Dis*<br>
*Circle VI: The Heretics*<br>
Furies, halting our nervous pair, incite<br>
an angel to descend and clear the way,<br>
where heretics, crowded in tombs, alight.<br>
<br>
*Circle VI: The Heretics*<br>
Proud Farinata rises to waylay<br>
the two, as they pass buried Epicures.<br>
Sad news, with dark prophecy, he repays.<br>
<br>
*Circle VI: The Heretics*<br>
Adjusting to the stench, Virgil confers<br>
hell’s order: incontinence, violence,<br>
then fraud—with ever increasing tortures.<br>
<br>
*Circle VII Outer Ring: Violent to Others*<br>
Half-bull dismissed, they see a turbulent<br>
stream of boiling blood immersing tyrants<br>
and killers, watch’d by centaurs with bows bent.<br>
<br>
*Circle VII Middle Ring: Violent to Self*<br>
Self-killers turn into trees, who spout grunts<br>
and blood when snapped and someday will hang bodies.<br>
Nude squanderers flee, the prey of dog hunts.<br>
<br>
*Circle VII Inner Ring: Blasphemers*<br>
A rain of fire justly rewards blasphemies<br>
in this circle of sand, cross’d only via tears<br>
flowing from the Old Man’s diverse crevices.<br>
<br>
*Circle VII Inner Ring: Sodomites*<br>
Dantes’ mentor, Ser Brunetto, appears—<br>
seeking fame though blackened. He foretells his<br>
pupils’ exile, who says he’ll persevere.<br>
<br>
*Circle VII Inner Ring: More Sodomites*<br>
Three Florentines encircle Dante: “‘tis<br>
true, courtesy and valour flew our state?”<br>
They left saddened. Then Geryon, summoned, is.<br>
<br>
*Circle VII Inner Ring: Usurers*<br>
A serpent, scorpion, man—instantiate<br>
fraud—carried them down to the eighth dark ring,<br>
passing lenders who’d used an unfair rate.<br>
<br>
*Circle VIII Pouch I: Panders and Seducers*<br>
*Circle VIII Pouch II: Flatterers*<br>
The first of ten dikes is filled with marching<br>
pimps and seducers, whipped red. Jason’s there.<br>
Next, dipped in shit, are those damned for flatt’ring,<br>
<br>
*Circle VIII Pouch III: Simonists*<br>
then buried priests, flaming feet in the air,<br>
who pimped dear Jesus’ bride for gold.<br>
Indignant Dante calls the pope’s pain fair.<br>
<br>
*Circle VIII Pouch IV: Diviners*<br>
The mages contort their necks, and behold<br>
there buttocks fore’er. Rejecting pity,<br>
our guide utters a story that’s scrambled.<br>
<br>
*Circle VIII Pouch V: Barrators*<br>
Corrupt officials boil in tar and flee<br>
from poking demons, who’d sooner harm than<br>
guide the two, if not for heaven holy.<br>
<br>
*Circle VIII Pouch V: With Demons*<br>
The escorts hook a tardy denizen<br>
of the pit, who’s questioned ‘between torment,<br>
escapes, leaving tarred captors. We’re free again.<br>
<br>
*Circle VIII Pouch VI: Hypocrites*<br>
A sliding escape. The hypocrites, bent<br>
by painted lead cloaks, trudge o’re pharisees.<br>
Two false fat friars direct their ascent.<br>
<br>
*Circle VIII Pouch VII: Thieves*<br>
After the climb, and breathing break, armies<br>
of snakes emerge below—who bite, hand-cuff,<br>
and somehow ignite frantic naked thieves.<br>
<br>
*Circle VIII Pouch VII: Thieves*<br>
Curses God<br>
Man turns into Snake<br>
<br>
*Circle VIII Pouch VIII: False Councselors Ulysses*<br>
<br>
*Circle VIII Pouch VIII: False Councselors Guido*<br>
<br>
*Circle VIII Pouch IX: Sowers of Scandal and Schism*<br>
<br>
*Circle VIII Pouch IX: Sowers of Scandal and Schism*<br>
*Circle VIII Pouch X: Falsifiers*<br>
