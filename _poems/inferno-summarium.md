  A poetic summary of the first part of Dante’s _Divine Comedy_

*Dark Wood*<br>
Dante, astray in a dark wood, sees light.<br>
Since leopard, lion, and wolf halt our ways,<br>
wise Virgil comes to guide us past our plight.<br>
<br>
*Dark Wood*<br>
The pilgrim, no Aeneas or Paul, stays.<br>
“Your Beatrice sent me, so have no fear—<br>
our path is sure, though into hell’s deep maze.”<br>
<br>
*Ante-Inferno*<br>
“Abandon every hope, who enter here,”<br>
declares the gate. Agnostics chase a flag,<br>
while unrepentant throng Acheron’s pier.<br>
<br>
*Circle I: Limbo*<br>
Sorrow without torments for those who lag<br>
the saving cross—Homer, Plato, and so.<br>
Castle and green uplifts though spirits sag.<br>
<br>
*Circle II: Lust*<br>
Shades confess, then Minos’ tail casts below.<br>
Tempests endlessly buffet the lusting.<br>
Our pilgrim faints for false Fransesca’s show.<br>
<br>
*Circle III: Gluttonous*<br>
Overeaters bark in the cold, falling,<br>
foul, filfth with the three-headed demon dog.<br>
A man foretells of the white Guelphs ending.<br>
<br>
*Circle IV: Spendthrifts and Prodigals*<br>
*Circle V: Wrathful and Slothful*<br>
Hoarders and spendthrifts, in a circular slog,<br>
roll weights to and fro. The wrathful damn’d fight<br>
while the slothful’s bubbles cover the bog.<br>
<br>
*The Gate of Dis*<br>
*Circle VI: The Heretics*<br>
Furies, halting our nervous pair, incite<br>
an angel to descend and clear the way,<br>
where heretics, crowded in tombs, alight.<br>
<br>
*Circle VI: The Heretics*<br>
Proud Farinata rises to waylay<br>
the two, as they pass buried Epicures.<br>
Sad news, with dark prophecy, he repays.<br>
<br>
*Circle VI: The Heretics*<br>
Adjusting to the stench, Virgil confers<br>
hell’s order: incontinence, violence,<br>
then fraud—with ever increasing tortures.<br>
<br>
*Circle VII Outer Ring: Violent to Others*<br>
Half-bull dismissed, they see a turbulent<br>
stream of boiling blood immersing tyrants<br>
and killers, watch’d by centaurs with bows bent.<br>
<br>
*Circle VII Middle Ring: Violent to Self*<br>
<br>
<br>
