<blockquote>
<p>A baby is born and the parents love the baby.</p>
<p>A baby is born and the parents raise the baby.</p>
<p>A baby is born and the parents teach it words.</p>
<p>The words come slowly.</p>
<p>The words grow longer</p>
<p>And the words grow clearer.</p>
<p>The child is taught to act.</p>
<p>The acts of the child are bad.</p>
<p>The child is taught discipline.</p>
<p>The child grows into a person.</p>
<p>And this person lives how they please.</p>
<p>Pleasures and pursuits fill its time.</p>
<p>Life's pain encroaches.</p>
<p>The person looks for meaning</p>
<p>And the person searches for purpose</p>
<p>And the person asks how to live.</p>
<p>Religion tells this person how to live.</p>
<p>Religion tells this person what exists</p>
<p>What exists but is not seen.</p>
<p>How do they know?</p>
<p>How do they trust the words of the ancient books,</p>
<p>The words passed down through the ages</p>
<p>The words of the prophets</p>
<p>The words of the priests?</p>
<p>I want to act well.</p>
<p>I want to not do what I should not do</p>
<p>And do what I should do.</p>
<p>The words of the priests tell me what to do!</p>
<p>The prophets speak out!</p>
<p>The ancient books pass along their wisdom.</p>
<p>But how can I trust their knowledge?</p>
<p>How can I know?</p>
</blockquote>
