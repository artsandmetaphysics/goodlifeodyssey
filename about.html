<h2>The Author</h2>
<p>I live in New York City with my wife and daughter, and I run a
medical software development company.</p>
<p>I enjoy reading, thinking, and writing. I'm especially interested in
how to live the good life and how to know what the good life is.</p>
<p>I write anonymously, due to the sensitive nature of the topic.</p>
<p>Please send comments or questions to <a
href="mailto:author@goodlifeodyssey.com">author@goodlifeodyssey.com</a>.</p>
<h2>This Site</h2>
<p>The essays represent my current thoughts on a topic and are revised
with my view.</p>
<p>The dialogues are meant to to represents and reflect on both sides of
a debate. Often my dialogues are loosely inspired by real discussions. I
revise them as I learn new arguments.</p>
<p>The meditations are short pieces, that reflect my thoughts and
questions at a particular point in time. I only rarely edit these once
written.</p>
<p>The notes and commentary are likely less interesting to a general
audience; they contain many quotations and my summaries on various
worksâ€”mostly classics. I worry that the number and length of the
quotations I included extends beyond what is allowable by fair use; as
best I can tell, they do not, but I sincerely hope not to cause harm to
any of the translators, authors, or publishers I quote.</p>
<p>I hope that the occasional visitor will contact me and share new
ideas with me. To facilitate staying in touch with readers, I set up an
email list.</p>
