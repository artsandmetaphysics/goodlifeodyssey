## Introduction

The *Metamorphoses* is Ovid’s epic poem about change, which opens with these lines:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>My mind leads me to speak now of forms changed</p>
<p>into new bodies: O gods above, inspire</p>
<p>this undertaking (which you’ve changed as well)</p>
<p>and guide my poem in its epic sweep</p>
<p>from the world’s beginning to the present day.</p>
</blockquote>

The poem is about 12,000 lines of hexameter verse in Latin, and is split into 15 books. It was first published in 8 AD.

Ovid focuses on telling the many stories using beautiful and light-hearted language. His audience was familiar with the stories he tells, so it is his approach to telling the stories that makes them as entertaining as they are.

## Book I

In Ovid’s creation account, like Hesiod’s, the world begins in Chaos:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Before the seas and lands had been created,</p>
<p>before the sky that covers everything,</p>
<p>Nature displayed a single aspect only</p>
<p>throughout the cosmos; Chaos was its name,</p>
<p>a shapeless, unwrought mass of inert bulk</p>
<p>and nothing more, with the discordant seeds</p>
<p>of disconnected elements all heaped</p>
<p>together in anarchic disarray.</p>
</blockquote>

However, unlike Hesiod’s account—which focuses on the sexual creative acts of the gods and their genealogies—Ovid’s ignores the gods almost entirely.

And unlike in the Genesis account, where God creates and separates, in Ovid matter existed in the beginning and only had to be separated:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Although the land and sea and air were present,</p>
<p>land was unstable, the sea unfit for swimming,</p>
<p>and air lacked light; shapes shifted constantly,</p>
<p>and all things were at odds with one another,</p>
<p>for in a single mass cold strove with warm,</p>
<p>wet was opposed to dry and soft to hard,</p>
<p>and weightlessness to matter having weight.</p>
<p>Some god (or kinder nature) settled this</p>
<p>dispute by separating earth from heaven,</p>
<p>and then by separating sea from earth</p>
<p>and fluid aether from the denser air;</p>
<p>and after these were separated out</p>
<p>and liberated from the primal heap,</p>
<p>he bound the disentangled elements</p>
<p>each in its place and all in harmony.</p>
</blockquote>

He describes how the four winds are separated:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Nor did that world-creating god permit</p>
<p>the winds to roam ungoverned through the air;</p>
<p>for even now, with each of them in charge</p>
<p>of his own kingdom, and their blasts controlled,</p>
<p>they scarcely can be kept from shattering</p>
<p>the world, such is the discord between brothers.</p>
<p>Eurus went eastward, to the lands of Dawn,</p>
<p>the kingdoms of Arabia and Persia,</p>
<p>and to the mountain peaks that lie below</p>
<p>the morning’s rays; and Zephyr took his place</p>
<p>on the western shores warmed by the setting sun.</p>
<p>The frozen north and Scythia were seized</p>
<p>by bristling Boreas; the lands opposite,</p>
<p>continually drenched by fog and rain,</p>
<p>are where the south wind, known as Auster, dwells.</p>
</blockquote>

After creation, Ovid describes the four ages of man. It is similar to Hesiod’s ages of man in _Works and Days_. Here are the vices of the Iron Age:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Now men demand that the rich earth provide</p>
<p>more than the crops and sustenance it owes,</p>
<p>and piercing to the bowels of the earth,</p>
<p>the wealth long hidden in Stygian gloom</p>
<p>is excavated and induces evil;</p>
<p>for iron, which is harmful, and the more</p>
<p>pernicious gold (now first produced) create</p>
<p>grim warfare, which has need of both; now arms</p>
<p>are grasped in bloodstained hands; men live off plunder,</p>
<p>and guest has no protection from his host,</p>
<p>nor father-in-law from his daughter’s husband,</p>
<p>and kindness between brothers is infrequent;</p>
<p>husband and wife both wish each other dead,</p>
<p>and wicked stepmothers concoct the bilious</p>
<p>poisons that turn their youthful victims pale;</p>
<p>a son goes to a soothsayer to learn</p>
<p>the date when he will change from heir to owner,</p>
<p>and piety lies vanquished here below.</p>
<p>Virgin Astraea, the last immortal left</p>
<p>on the bloodstained earth, withdraws from it in horror.</p>
</blockquote>

Here is part of Hesiod’s description of the Iron Age:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Then fathers won’t get along with their kids anymore,</p>
<p>Nor guests with their hosts, nor partner with partner,</p>
<p>And brothers won’t be friends, the way they used to be.</p>
<p>Nobody’ll honor their parents when they get old</p>
<p>But they’ll curse them and give them a hard time,</p>
<p>Godless rascals, and never think about paying them back</p>
<p>For all the trouble it was to raise them.</p>
<p>⋯</p>
<p>And then up to Olympos from the wide-pathed Earth,</p>
<p>lovely apportions wrapped in white veils,</p>
<p>off to join the Immortals, abandoning humans</p>
<p>There go Shame and Nemesis. And horrible suffering</p>
<p>Will be left for mortal men, and no defense against evil.</p>
<cite>— Works and Days, 212–35</cite>
</blockquote>

Both accounts imply new technologies, such as bronze, iron, and perhaps gold coinage, cause new evils. Both accounts look to an earlier, purer time. A time when the gods still lived on Earth.

Unlike Hesiod, Ovid does does not include the aberrant Age of Heroes in between the bronze and iron ages. The Age of Heroes, unlike the other four, is not named after a metal (it is better than the previous age). I think Hesiod inserted it to meld an older tradition of the metal ages with the Greek’s own tradition of the heroes of Thebes and the Trojan ware.

In response to the wickedness of the Iron Age, Jove calls for a great flood. Unlike the Babylonian Atrahasis flood myth—wherein the gods regret destroying their source of sacrifices—in Ovid, the gods have more foresight:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Some of the gods give voice to their approval</p>
<p>of Jove’s words and aggravate his grumbling,</p>
<p>while others play their roles with mute assent.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, all of them were saddened</p>
<p>by the proposed destruction of the human race</p>
<p>and wondered what the future form of earth</p>
<p>could possibly be like, without men on it:</p>
<p>why, who would bring the incense to their altars?</p>
</blockquote>

Ovid’s description of the flood is powerful:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>One takes to the hills, another to his skiff,</p>
<p>rowing where once he plowed the earth in rows,</p>
<p>while yet another sails above his grainfields,</p>
<p>or glimpses, far below, his sunken villa;</p>
<p>and here in the topmost branches of an elm</p>
<p>is someone casting out a fishing line;</p>
<p>an anchor grazes in a meadow’s grasses,</p>
<p>or a curved keel sweeps above a vineyard,</p>
<p>and the seal’s misshapen figure lies at rest</p>
<p>where the slender goats were lately fond of browsing.</p>
<p>The Nereids marvel at the sight of groves,</p>
<p>cities, and dwelling places all submerged,</p>
<p>while dolphins take possession of the woods</p>
<p>and shake the lofty branches of the oak</p>
<p>as they brush by. The wolf swims among sheep,</p>
<p>the tawny lion and the tiger both</p>
<p>are carried helplessly upon the waves;</p>
<p>the boar’s great power, like a lightning bolt,</p>
<p>does not avail nor do the stag’s swift limbs.</p>
<p>After his long search for a landing place,</p>
<p>the bird with weary wings collapses seaward.</p>
<p>Now unrestrained, the sea conceals the hills,</p>
<p>and strange new waves beat at the mountaintops;</p>
<p>the greater part are drowned beneath the waves,</p>
<p>while those spared drowning perish of starvation.</p>
</blockquote>

Jove stops the flood when he realizes the two human survivors are devout. After describing how the floods recede, Ovid recounts what Deucalian, the last man alive, says to his wife Pyrrha:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“O sister, wife, and only woman left,</p>
<p>you whom the bonds of race and family</p>
<p>and our marriage bed have joined to me,</p>
<p>we are now joined by our common perils—</p>
<p>for we two are the crowd that fills the lands</p>
<p>seen by the rising and the setting sun—</p>
<p>we two are all: the sea now has the others.</p>
<p>And our claim upon our lives is still</p>
<p>doubtful, for those storm clouds frighten me!</p>
<p>And how would you be feeling, my poor wretch,</p>
<p>if fate had snatched you from the flood without me?</p>
<p>How would you bear this terror all alone?</p>
<p>Who would console you in your unshared grief?</p>
<p>For trust me, if the sea had taken you,</p>
<p>I would have followed then, my wife; the sea</p>
<p>would not have taken one of us, but two.”</p>
</blockquote>

While few stories in the _Metamorphoses_ are original, Ovid gives the old characters a new psychological depth; Deucalion’s terror at being the only human alive is vivid example of this.

Ovid explains how life was biogenerated from the muck (an accepted theory at the time):

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>It is when heat and moisture join as one</p>
<p>that life is generated; all living forms</p>
<p>originate from these opposing sources</p>
</blockquote>

The Python is among the forms that are generated, and Ovid tells the tale of Apollo killing the Python (and establishing the Pythian games to ensure memory of his great dead). Next, Ovid weaves in the first rape story of the _Metamorphoses_:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Daphne, the daughter of the river god</p>
<p>Peneus, was the first love of Apollo;</p>
<p>this happened not by chance, but by the cruel</p>
<p>outrage of Cupid; Phoebus, in the triumph</p>
<p>of his great victory against the Python,</p>
<p>observed him bending back his bow and said,</p>
<p>“What are <em>you</em> doing with such manly arms,</p>
<p>lascivious boy? That bow befits <em>our</em> brawn,</p>
<p>wherewith we deal out wounds to savage beasts</p>
<p>and other mortal foes, unerringly:</p>
<p>just now with our innumerable arrows</p>
<p>we managed to lay low the mighty Python,</p>
<p>whose pestilential belly covered acres!</p>
<p>Content yourself with kindling love affairs</p>
<p>with your wee torch—and don’t claim <em>our</em> glory!”</p>
<p>The son of Venus answered him with this:</p>
<p>“Your arrow, Phoebus, may strike everything;</p>
<p>mine will strike you: as animals to gods,</p>
<p>your glory is so much less than mine!”</p>
</blockquote>

Ovid’s ability to weave one story into the next makes the Metamorphoses a joy to read. Here, Apollo’s pride at defeating the Python causes him to foolishly boast, propelling us into the next story while also presenting a compelling example of overconfidence.

Daphne escapes, but Io is less fortunate. Jove rapes her, and then he turns her into a cow to hide her from Juno, who, knowing as much, convinces him to hand over the cow.  Juno places Argus to watch over her:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>… Argus, the watchman with a hundred eyes:</p>
<p>in strict rotation, his eyes slept in pairs,</p>
<p>while those that were not sleeping stayed on guard.</p>
<p>No matter where he stood, he looked at Io,</p>
<p>even when he had turned his back on her.</p>
</blockquote>

While a cow, Io’s father makes an interesting comment:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“Nor can I end this suffering by death;</p>
<p>it is a hurtful thing to be a god,</p>
<p>for the gates of death are firmly closed against me,</p>
<p>and our sorrows must go on forever.”</p>
</blockquote>

Jove can’t bear to watch her pain, so he sends Mercury to kill Argus. Mercury lulls Argus to sleep with a tale:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Now Mercury was ready to continue [his story]</p>
<p>until he saw that Argus had succumbed,</p>
<p>for all his eyes had been closed down by sleep.</p>
<p>He silences himself and waves his wand</p>
<p>above those languid orbs to fix the spell.</p>
<p>Without delay he grasps the nodding head</p>
<p>and where it joins the neck, he severs it</p>
<p>with his curved blade and flings it bleeding down</p>
<p>the steep rock face, staining it with gore.</p>
<p>O Argus, you are fallen, and the light</p>
<p>in all your lamps is utterly put out:</p>
<p>one hundred eyes, one darkness all the same!</p>
<p>But Saturn’s daughter rescued them and set</p>
<p>those eyes upon the feathers of her bird,</p>
<p>filling his tail with constellated gems.</p>
</blockquote>

Many of Ovid’s stories explain the origin of species (especially of birds), rivers, springs, and constellations.

Note that the tale that Mercury tells Argus is about the rape of Syrinx; rape is so common that the story puts Argus to sleep (although his wand may have helped too).

## Book II

The tale of Phaëthon’s doomed journey is one of my favourite in Ovid. Here is the description of Apollo’s throne room:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Phoebus sat</p>
<p>In robes of purple high upon a throne</p>
<p>that glittered brilliantly with emeralds;</p>
<p>and in attendance on his left and right</p>
<p>stood Day and Month and Year and Century,</p>
<p>and all the Hours, evenly divided;</p>
<p>fresh Spring was there, adorned with floral crown,</p>
<p>and Summer, naked, bearing ripened grain,</p>
<p>and Autumn, stained from treading out her grapes,</p>
<p>and Winter with his grey and frosty locks.</p>
</blockquote>

When describing the burning Earth, Ovid’s description alludes back to the _Iliad_ (20.60–67):

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>The soil cracks everywhere, and now the light</p>
<p>seeps to the underworld and terrifies</p>
<p>its ruler and his wife</p>
</blockquote>

After Zeus kills Phaëthon with lightening, Apollo mourns:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>His miserable father, sick with grief,</p>
<p>drew his cloak up around his head in mourning;</p>
<p>for one whole day then, if the tale is true,</p>
<p>the sun was quite put out. The conflagration</p>
<p>(for the world was still ablaze) provided light;</p>
<p>that was a time some good came out of evil.</p>
</blockquote>

The stories in the _Metamorphoses_ frequently refer to earlier incidents. For example:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>When Apollo heard</p>
<p>the accusation brought against his lover,</p>
<p>the laurel resting on his brow slipped down;</p>
<p>in not as much time as it takes to tell,</p>
<p>his face, his lyre, his high color fell!</p>
</blockquote>

Also, when Juno is departing from Tethys and Oceanus in Book II, she rides up on “peacocks fitted out with Argus’ eyes”—another reference to book I.

The reference to the laurel tree refers back to the Daphne story in Book I—perhaps hinting that Apollo has already moved on to another lover.

Almost all of the stories end with physical transformations. I like how Ovid describes Ocyrhoë’s transformation into a horse:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>It seems my human form is being taken:</p>
<p>the thought of grass for dinner pleases me,</p>
<p>and open fields, where I can freely ride</p>
<p>as I become my relative—a mare!</p>
<p>Whole horse? But why? My father is but a centaur!”</p>
<p>Her whining, waning, becomes whinnying,</p>
<p>as mind and speech both grow confused together,</p>
<p>and for a moment seemed a sound between</p>
<p>the noise a horse makes and a human word,</p>
<p>more like someone who imitates a horse,</p>
<p>before the sound turned clearly into neighing,</p>
<p>as she went on all fours through the tall grass.</p>
<p>Her fingers fused together and a single</p>
<p>band of light horn surrounded them, a hoof.</p>
<p>Her neck and mouth were both increased in size</p>
<p>and her long robe was turned into a tail</p>
<p>while the hair that used to stray across her neck</p>
<p>became a mane that fell on her right side;</p>
<p>made over now in voice and form completely,</p>
<p>this transformation gave her a new name.</p>
</blockquote>

The story of Mercury stealing Apollo’s cattle is also told in the Homeric Hymn to Dionysus. Ovid’s version is shorter, and there are differences, but in both there is an old man who betrays the location of the cattle. (In Ovid’s version the man is less devout and gives away the location confidentially and with little hesitation). It is intriguing to see the development of the story over several centuries.

Minerva visits the goddess Envy to have her enact revenge on irreverent follower. The description of Envy is, even for Ovid, exceptionally vivid:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>She headed straight to Envy’s squalid quarters,</p>
<p>black with corruption, hidden deep within</p>
<p>a sunless valley where no breezes blow,</p>
<p>a sad and sluggish place, richly frigid,</p>
<p>where cheerful fires die upon the hearth</p>
<p>and fog that never lifts embraces all.</p>
<p>Arriving here, the warlike maiden stood</p>
<p>before the house (for heaven’s law denied</p>
<p>her entrance) and with her spear tip rapped</p>
<p>upon the doors, which instantly flew open,</p>
<p>revealing Envy at her feast of snakes,</p>
<p>a fitting meal for her corrupted nature:</p>
<p>from such a sight, the goddess turned away.</p>
<p>The object of her visit sluggishly</p>
<p>arises from the ground where she’d been sitting,</p>
<p>leaving behind her interrupted dinner</p>
<p>of half-eaten reptiles. Stiffly she advances,</p>
<p>and when she sees the beauty of the goddess</p>
<p>and of her armor, she cannot help but groan,</p>
<p>and makes a face, and sighs a wretched sigh.</p>
<p>Then she grows pale, and her body shrivels up.</p>
<p>Her glance is sidewise and her teeth are black;</p>
<p>her nipples drip with poisonous green bile,</p>
<p>and venom from her dinner coats her tongue;</p>
<p>she only smiles at sight of another’s grief,</p>
<p>nor does she know, disturbed by wakeful cares,</p>
<p>the benefits of slumber; when she beholds</p>
<p>another’s joy, she falls into decay,</p>
<p>and rips down only to be ripped apart,</p>
<p>herself the punishment for being her.</p>
</blockquote>

After Io and Callisto, Jove pursues Europa:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Majestic power and erotic love</p>
<p>do not get on together very well,</p>
<p>nor do they linger long in the same place:</p>
<p>the father and the ruler of all gods,</p>
<p>who holds the lightning bolt in his right hand</p>
<p>and shakes the world when he but nods his head,</p>
<p>now relinquishes authority and power,</p>
<p>assuming the appearance of a bull</p>
<p>to mingle with the other cattle, lowing</p>
<p>as gorgeously he strolls in the new grass.</p>
</blockquote>

## Book III

After Europa is stolen, her father “in an action bother paternal and perverse” demands that Cadmus, her brother, find her. Unable to, he decides to flee Tyre and found the new city of Boeotian Thebes. Incidentally, Herodotus believed that Cadmus brought the Phoenician alphabet to the Greeks (_The Histories_ 5.58).

While founding Thebes, a great serpent kills many of Cadmus’ men, and so he pursues and kills the serpent. Afterwards, Athena instructs him to sow the serpent’s seeds into the ground.

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>And then, incredibly, the dull clods stir:</p>
<p>at first only the little tips of spears</p>
<p>are visible, emerging from the furrows,</p>
<p>but these, almost at once are followed by</p>
<p>the brightly painted waving crests of helmets</p>
<p>then shoulders, breasts, and arms heavy with weapons,</p>
<p>and finally a dense-packed mass of shields:</p>
<p>no different from what you will have seen</p>
<p>on feats days, in the theater, when the curtain</p>
<p>lifts from the pit, and the images of men</p>
<p>painted upon it seem to rise: heads first,</p>
<p>and then the rest of them, little by little,</p>
<p>drawn up in one unbroken wave until</p>
<p>the tiny figures stand erect onstage,</p>
<p>complete in all respects, from head to feet.</p>
</blockquote>

And then these men fight each other until Athena stops them. These so-called sown men (Spartoi) founded Thebes with Cadmus. I think this is the oddest story in the Metamorphoses, and I wonder what significance it had to the ancient Greeks.

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Thebes has been founded now, and even though</p>
<p>an exile still, you might seem fortunate</p>
<p>in having Mars and Venus as your in-laws,</p>
<p>Cadmus; nor is this all, for in addition</p>
<p>are offspring worthy of your noble wife,</p>
<p>your sons and daughters, the pledges of your love,</p>
<p>and grandsons too, already grown to manhood.</p>
<p>But “fortunate”? A judgment best reserved</p>
<p>for a man’s last day: call no one blest, until</p>
<p>he dies and the last rites are said for him.</p>
</blockquote>

This reasoning is pervasive in Herodotus.

Actaeon stumbles across the virgin goddess Diana, who spitefully turns him into a stag. He is subsequently torn to pieces by his own pack of hunting dogs. (In the _Epic of Gilgamesh_, when Gilgamesh is rejecting Ishtar’s love entreaties, he mentions how she turned a prior lover into a wolf who was then chased by his own hunting dogs.)

Actaeon is caught, and his dogs tear him to pieces.

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>And it is said</p>
<p>he did not die until his countless wounds</p>
<p>had satisfied Diana’s awful wrath.</p>
<p>Folks were divided: there were those who found</p>
<p>the goddess’s actions cruel and unjust,</p>
<p>while others considered them appropriate</p>
<p>to the defense of her austere virginity.</p>
<p>As usual, both parties had their reasons.</p>
</blockquote>

Throughout the _Metamorphoses_ Ovid playfully questions the god’s morals, as in this quote.

After the Actaeon story, Jove falls for Semele—Cadmus’ daughter. Semele becomes pregnant and Juno, to protect her honor, tricks Semele into requesting Jove make love to her the way he does to Juno. Unbeknownst to Semele, this will kill her. Juno takes the form of Semele’s nurse.

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>A long, inveigling chat of this and that,</p>
<p>until Jove’s name came up. Nurse sighted and said,</p>
<p>“I <em>hope</em> he’s Jupiter—although I doubt it:</p>
<p>the divinity plea? An all-to-common ploy</p>
<p>among seducers. Suppose he is, though:</p>
<p>make him provide assurance of his love;</p>
<p>if he’s the real thing, ask him to put on</p>
<p>all of the trappings of his high office</p>
<p>and embrace you, showing such almighty splendor</p>
<p>as when he is received by Lady Juno.”</p>
</blockquote>

(It is difficult to imagine a woman being seduced by a man claiming to be a god.)

After Juno gets her revenge on Semele, her next victim is Tiresias. Tiresias is blinded for agreeing with Jove that women enjoy sex more than men. Tiresias is then blinded by Juno, but Jove (since “one god can’t undo another’s doing”) gives him the gift of prophecy. Jove seems to enjoy thwarting Juno’s punishments—consider also the Callisto story.

Tiresias is a recurring character in the Greek tragedies.

Tiresias’ first prediction is that Narcissus, if he knows himself, will not live to old age. The meaning of this was unclear, until Narcissus falls in love with himself. Then Tiresias becomes famous.

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“But <em>now</em> I get it! <em>I</em> am that other one!</p>
<p>I’ve finally seen through my own image!</p>
<p>I burn with love for—<em>me</em>! The spark I kindle</p>
<p>is the torch I carry: whatever can I do?</p>
<p>Am I the favor-seeker, or the favor sought?</p>
<p>“Why seek at all, when all that I desire</p>
<p>is mine already? Riches in such abundance</p>
<p>that I’ve been left completely without means!”</p>
</blockquote>

Ovid paints a compelling, yet humorous, picture of obsession with his description of Narcissus’ death:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>His last words were directed to the pool:</p>
<p>“Alas, dear boy, whom I have vainly cherished!”</p>
<p>Those words returned to him again, and when</p>
<p>he cried “Farewell!” “<em>Farewell!</em>” cried Echo back.</p>
<p>His weary head sank to the grass; death closed</p>
<p>those eyes transfixed once by their master’s beauty,</p>
<p>but on the ferry ride across the Styx,</p>
<p>his gaze into its current did not waver.</p>
</blockquote>

Acoetes’ story is similar to the seventh Homeric Hymn to Dionysus.

## Book IV

Most of Book IV is a sequence of stories told by the Minyas daughters, who refuse to join Bacchus’ festival.

The first of their stories, of the suicide of Pyramus and Thisbe, is the original inspiration that lead Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet (with a few other versions in between). Pyramus’ suicide is described with an epic simile:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“He carries Thisbe’s cloak to the tree of their pact,</p>
<p>and presses tears and kisses on the fabric.</p>
<p>‘Drink <em>my</em> blood now,’ he says, drawing his sword,</p>
<p>and thrusting it at once in his own guts:</p>
<p>a fatal blow; dying, he draws the blade</p>
<p>out of his burning wound, and his lifeblood</p>
<p>follows it, jetting high into the air,</p>
<p>as he lies on his back upon the ground.</p>
<p>It was as when a water pipe is ruptured</p>
<p>where the lead has rotted, and it springs a leak:</p>
<p>a column of water goes hissing through the hole</p>
<p>and parts the air with its pulsating thrusts;</p>
<p>splashed with his gore, the tree’s pale fruit grow dark;</p>
<p>blood soaks its roots and surges up to dye</p>
<p>the hanging berries purple with its color.”</p>
</blockquote>

The two lovers planned to meet at the tomb of Ninus, who was the king of Assyria and husband of Semiramis. Semiramis was a legendary queen of Assyria. She is often associated with the historical queen Sammurāmat who ruled from 811 - 808 BC.

The story of Hermaphroditus is a rare example of a woman (sort of) raping a man. The description includes a progression of similes:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“‘I’ve won, the boy is mine!’</p>
<p>the nymph cries out, and tearing off her clothing,</p>
<p>she dives into the middle of the pool,</p>
<p>and though he fights her, holds him in her clutches,</p>
<p>seizing the kisses he is loath to yield;</p>
<p>her hands surprise him, coming from below,</p>
<p>caressing that reluctant breast of his—</p>
<p>although he strives to tear himself away,</p>
<p>the nymph—now here, now there—surrounds her prey,</p>
<p>just as the serpent wraps herself around</p>
<p>the eagle when he grasps her in his talons</p>
<p>and takes her up: dangling from his claws,</p>
<p>she twines herself between his head and feet</p>
<p>and with her tail, immobilizes him;</p>
<p>or just as ivy winds around a tree,</p>
<p>and as the octopus beneath the sea</p>
<p>securely binds the prey that it has captured</p>
<p>with tentacles sent out in all directions;</p>
<p>yet still the boy denies the nymph her bliss’”</p>
</blockquote>

A description of the underworld:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>There are a thousand ways into this city,</p>
<p>and open gates on all sides; as the ocean</p>
<p>receives the rivers from around the world,</p>
<p>so this place gathers in all mortal souls,</p>
<p>and never fills, however many come.</p>
<p>Here bloodless, boneless, bodiless shades stray:</p>
<p>some make their way to the forum; others seek</p>
<p>the palace of the ruler of the dead,</p>
<p>or take up once again the crafts they lived by.</p>
</blockquote>

Juno’s frustrated jealous rage fills much of the first four books of Ovid. She eventually drives Cadmus and Harmonia into ruin. Although Juno caused much of their suffering, the story of their transformation (which has may favourite imagery in the book) implies that it was Cadmus’ killing of the serpent that lead to his woes:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“Was it a sacred serpent that I speared,”</p>
<p>asked Cadmus, “when, newly come from Sidon,</p>
<p>I sprinkled the viper’s teeth upon the ground,</p>
<p>and seeded a new crop of human beings?</p>
<p>If that is what the gods have been avenging</p>
<p>by their unwavering wrath for all these years,</p>
<p>why then, I pray that I might be extended</p>
<p>into a serpent with a gut-like shape—”</p>
<p>And as he said it he became a serpent</p>
<p>with a gut-like shape. At once he felt the scales</p>
<p>begin to grow out on his thickened skin,</p>
<p>and his dark body lighten up with patches</p>
<p>of iridescent blue; he fell upon his breast,</p>
<p>and his two legs were blended into one,</p>
<p>which, gradually lengthening, became</p>
<p>an elegant and sharply pointed tail.</p>
<p>His arms remained unchanged; he held them out,</p>
<p>and as the tears coursed down his cheeks (which were</p>
<p>still—for the moment—human), he exclaimed,</p>
<p>“Come closer to me, O most wretched wife,</p>
<p>and while there is still something left of me,</p>
<p>before I am entirely transformed</p>
<p>to serpent, touch me, take these hands in yours!”</p>
<p>He would have said much more, but suddenly</p>
<p>the tip of his tongue divided into two,</p>
<p>and words no longer would obey his wishes,</p>
<p>so that whenever he tried to complain</p>
<p>or grieve, he hissed, and could not manage more,</p>
<p>for he had been left with no other voice.</p>
<p>Now striking her bare breast, his wife cries out,</p>
<p>“Cadmus! Stay as you are! Put off these strange</p>
<p>shapes now possessing you, unfortunate man!</p>
<p>Cadmus, what’s happening? Where are your feet?</p>
<p>Your face? Complexion? Even as I speak,</p>
<p>where is the rest of you! Heavenly beings,</p>
<p>will you not also turn me to a snake?”</p>
<p>The creature’s tongue flicked lightly over her lips,</p>
<p>and he slipped in between her cherished breasts</p>
<p>as though he were familiar with the place,</p>
<p>embraced her, and slid right around her neck.</p>
<p>Those of his companions who were present</p>
<p>were horrified, but she just calmly stroked</p>
<p>the smooth, sleek neck of the crested dragon,</p>
<p>and at once there were two serpents intertwined,</p>
<p>who presently went crawling off and found</p>
<p>a hiding place within a nearby grove.</p>
</blockquote>

Perseus turns Atlas into a mountain:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Atlas became a mountain just as large</p>
<p>as the man had been. His hair and beard became</p>
<p>a forest, and his arms and shoulders turned</p>
<p>into adjacent ridges; his head was now</p>
<p>the mountain’s summit and his bones were rock.</p>
<p>Each part grew to extraordinary size</p>
<p>(as you immortals had ordained), until</p>
<p>the weight of heaven rested on his shoulders.</p>
</blockquote>

## Book V

Perseus slays many men at his wedding to Andromeda, when her prior betrothed casts a spear at him. The scene seems to contrast and slyly tease Homer’s epic death scenes. One of my favourite is:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Pedasus, grinning,</p>
<p>saw how he kept himself and his instrument</p>
<p>out of harm’s way, and shouted to him, “Sing</p>
<p>the remainder of your song to the shades below,”</p>
<p>lodging his shaft above the bard’s left eye;</p>
<p>and as he fell, his dying fingers struck</p>
<p>the lyre’s strings, and on that plaintive note</p>
<p>the poet and his song came to an end.</p>
</blockquote>

After describing dying men, one after another, Ovid says:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>It really would take far too long to name</p>
<p>the ordinary soldiers</p>
</blockquote>

Minerva visits the nine muses, who tell of the nine sisters who challenged their supremacy and of the contest between them, and retell the story by which they won the contest. As part of this story, Venus makes the following comment:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“‘“My son [Cupid], my sword, my strong right arm and source of my power,</p>
<p>take up that weapon by which all your victims are vanquished</p>
<p>and send your swift arrows into the breast of the deity</p>
<p>to whom the last part of the threefold realm was allotted.</p>
<p>You govern the gods and their ruler; you rule the defeated</p>
<p>gods of the ocean and govern the one who rules them, too;</p>
<p>why give up on the dead, when we can extend our empire</p>
<p>into their realm? A third part of the world is involved here!</p>
<p>And yet the celestial gods spurn our forbearance,</p>
<p>and the prestige of Love is diminished, even as mine is.</p>
<p>Do you not see how Athena and huntress Diana</p>
<p>have both taken leave of me? The virgin daughter of Ceres</p>
<p>desires to do likewise—and will, if we let her!</p>
<p>But if you take pride in our alliance, advance it</p>
<p>by joining her to her uncle!”‘“</p>
</blockquote>

Venus’ impulse leads to the rape of Persephone and (so they say) the rotation of the seasons.

## Book VI

This book continues the theme of divine revenge:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“To praise is insufficient,” she [Minerva] reflected;</p>
<p>“we will be praised—and we will not permit</p>
<p>those who belittle our divinity</p>
<p>to go unpunished!”</p>
</blockquote>

Minerva contests the Arachne—an expert weaver. Although she loses, she turns her competitor into a spider.

This simile from their contest is superb:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Into their fabrics they weave purple threads</p>
<p>of Tyrian dye, and place beside them shades</p>
<p>that lighten imperceptibly from these;</p>
<p>as when a storm ends and the sun comes out,</p>
<p>a rainbow’s arch illuminates the sky;</p>
<p>although a thousand colors shine in it,</p>
<p>they eye cannot say where one color ends</p>
<p>and another starts, so gradual the verging;</p>
<p>there in the middle, the colors look the same,</p>
<p>while, at the edges, they seem different.</p>
</blockquote>

The brief stories of Marsyas the Satyr and Pelops (Tantalus’ son) feel undeveloped and seem to be included because merely due the transformations involved.

The story of Tereus, the marauder from Thrace, and the Athenian sister-princesses, Procne and Philomela, is disturbing. Procne is given in marriage to Tereus, to prevent the defeat of Athens. After a few years, she asks her wicked husband to retrieve her sister—but he lusts after her:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>And now delay was unendurable:</p>
<p>he eagerly repeated Procne’s speech,</p>
<p>and raised his own desires under hers.</p>
<p>Love lent him eloquence, and when he seemed</p>
<p>to go beyond the mandate he’d been given,</p>
<p>he said that this was merely Procne’s wish,</p>
<p>and added tears, as though they too were part</p>
<p>of his commission. By the gods above,</p>
<p>what utter blindness dwells in human hearts!</p>
<p>Here Tereus achieves a reputation</p>
<p>for piety while plotting wickedness,</p>
<p>and criminal behavior wins him praise!</p>
</blockquote>

After trapping Philomela in a house in the woods and raping her, she cries:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“Nevertheless, if the gods are watching this,</p>
<p>if heavenly power means anything at all,</p>
<p>if, with my honor, all has not been lost,</p>
<p>somehow or other I will punish you;</p>
<p>I’ll cast aside my modesty and speak</p>
<p>of what you’ve done; if I escape this place,</p>
<p>I’ll go among the people with my tale;</p>
<p>imprisoned here, my voice will fill the trees</p>
<p>and wring great sobs of grief from senseless rocks!</p>
<p>Heaven will hear me, and what gods there are,</p>
<p><em>if</em> there are any gods in all of heaven!”</p>
<p>Such words provoke the savage tyrant’s wrath</p>
<p>and fear in equal measure</p>
</blockquote>

He proceeds to cut out her tongue.

## Book VII

Book VII begins with the story of Jason and the Golden Fleece.

Medea’s monologues are brilliant.

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“All your resistance is in vain, Medea;</p>
<p>what god opposes you, I do not know—</p>
<p>I wonder if this isn’t love, so called,</p>
<p>or something rather like it—for why else</p>
<p>would these ordeals imposed upon the strangers</p>
<p>by my own father seem too harsh to me?</p>
<p>Because they <em>are</em>! Why do I fear that one</p>
<p>whom I have only just now seen will die?</p>
<p>What is the power that can cause such fear?</p>
<p>There is a fire in your untried heart,</p>
<p>poor wretched girl! Dislodge it if you can!</p>
<p>I’d act more sanely, if I only could,</p>
<p>but this new power overwhelms my will;</p>
<p>reason advises this, and passion, that;</p>
<p>I see the better way, and I approve it,</p>
<p>while I pursue the worse.”</p>
</blockquote>

These lines remind me of Paul’s letter to the Romans, where he says:

<blockquote>
<p>I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate. Now if I do what I do not want, I agree that the law is good. But in fact it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells within me. For I know that nothing good dwells within me, that is, in my flesh. I can will what is right, but I cannot do it. For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I do. Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells within me. <cite>(Romans 7.15–20)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

In Medea’s speech, we hear her grasp onto a small reason to wish Jason well, and slowly expand and rationalize her thoughts. She continues going back and forth. At some point, she weighs whether she can trust Jason, even if she betrays her father:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“Will I betray the kingdom of my father,</p>
<p>only to have the stranger whom I save</p>
<p>set sail without me for another’s bed,</p>
<p>leaving Medea to her punishment?</p>
<p>If he could do that, leave me for another,</p>
<p>let the ingrate die! But no: that isn’t in him,</p>
<p>not in his face, not in his noble spirit,</p>
<p>not in  a man as beautiful as he,</p>
<p>that I should fear duplicity from him,</p>
<p>or his neglecting what I am deserved.”</p>
</blockquote>

These lines may ironically refer to Euripides’ play, _Medea_. Note that beauty and goodness are thought to be correlated.

The virgin princess weaves back and forth, but, upon seeing Jason again, decides to betray her family and flee with him.

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Here she was resolute, and her impulsive</p>
<p>ardor would appear to be extinguished—</p>
<p>but broke out once again at sight of Jason:</p>
<p>her cheeks reddened, and a suffusing glow</p>
<p>spread across her countenance completely,</p>
<p>as when a spark that has been hidden under</p>
<p>a crust of ash is nourished by a breeze</p>
<p>and comes to life again as it’s stirred up,</p>
<p>regaining all the vigor it once had;</p>
<p>just so her smoldering love, which you’d have thought</p>
<p>was almost out, came blazing up anew,</p>
<p>to see the young man standing in her presence,</p>
<p>and—as it happened—looking even better</p>
<p>than usual. You would have understood</p>
<p>and pardoned her for her infatuation.</p>
</blockquote>

After returning to Greece, Jason begs Medea to give his father a potion to lengthen his life. She complies:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>After nine days and nights had seen Medea</p>
<p>in her dragon-drive chariot, traversing</p>
<p>the skies above those regions, she returned</p>
<p>to her own home; her reptiles had been touched</p>
<p>only by the <em>odors</em> of those herbs,</p>
<p>and yet they shed the skins of their old age!</p>
</blockquote>

Ovid pokes fun at readers by not including the full list of ingredients:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>When, with these,</p>
<p>and with a thousand other such ingredients</p>
<p>(whose names we needn’t bother mentioning),</p>
<p>the miracle to come had been arranged,</p>
<p>the foreign woman took a long-dead branch</p>
<p>from a fruitful olive tree and stirred her pot,</p>
<p>mixing it thoroughly from top to bottom.</p>
<p>But look! Almost at once, that stick turned green,</p>
<p>and just a short time later put out leaves,</p>
<p>and suddenly was loaded down with fruit!</p>
</blockquote>

As Medea flies from this gruesome scene, Ovid lists transformation stories. Then, in a few succinct lines, he tells the story of Jason’s betrayal and Medea’s revenge:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>But after the new bride that Jason took</p>
<p>was poisoned by the old wife he forsook,</p>
<p>and fisherfolk off Corinth glimpsed through haze</p>
<p>the ruined palace of the king ablaze,</p>
<p>the blade that dripped with her own children’s gore</p>
<p>enraged their father, whom she fled before,</p>
<p>her fatal vengeance leaving all undone!</p>
</blockquote>

After Aegeus discovers his unknown son, Theseus, there is a big celebration. Then Ovid gives us this pithy line:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>And yet, no joy is ever unalloyed,</p>
<p>and worry worms its way into delight</p>
</blockquote>

Aegeus is worried about King Minos, who wants to revenge his dead son. Fortuneatly, Athens has a loyal ally ruling over Aegina. Cephalus seeks aid, and king Aeacus of Aegina recounts the story of the plague:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“At first the animals</p>
<p>alone succumbed: the plague confined itself</p>
<p>to dogs, birds, sheep, cattle, and wild beasts:</p>
<p>the luckless plowman is quite stunned to see</p>
<p>his healthy bulls collapsing at their work,</p>
<p>falling in midfurrow; woolly flocks</p>
<p>give a few feeble bleats, then, without help,</p>
<p>shed their thick coats, grow wasted and soon die;</p>
<p>the stall-bound horse, once famous for his speed,</p>
<p>but now unworthy of his victories,</p>
<p>ignores his former honors, whinnying</p>
<p>as death prepares to scratch him from the race.</p>
<p>The boar does not remember how to rage,</p>
<p>nor the deer to trust in swiftness, nor the bear</p>
<p>to cull the great herds with his fierce attacks;</p>
<p>a languor seizes all; in woods, in fields,</p>
<p>along the roads, the fetid corpses lie</p>
<p>until the air is blighted with the stench.</p>
<p>I’ll tell you something quite astonishing:</p>
<p>the greedy dogs and vultures—even wolves!—</p>
<p>left them untouched; those bodies fell apart,</p>
<p>sickening us with their apalling odor</p>
<p>and spreading foul contagion everywhere.</p>
<p>The plague, grown stronger, now advances on</p>
<p>the wretched country folk, then rules within</p>
<p>the walls of the great city. Its first symptom</p>
<p>is a fierce burning in the viscera,</p>
<p>the hidden fire indicated by</p>
<p>a flushed complexion, pain in drawing breath;</p>
<p>the patient’s roughened tongue swells up with fever,</p>
<p>and lips that have been parched by the hot winds</p>
<p>gape widely, snatching at the torpid air—</p>
<p>no bed nor covering is bearable;</p>
<p>they fling themselves facedown upon the ground</p>
<p>to cool their bodies off; but no: the heat</p>
<p>of their poor bodies warms the earth instead!</p>
<p>Ungovernable plague! The doctors die,</p>
<p>their arts a harm to their practitioners,</p>
<p>and those who are the closest to the sick,</p>
<p>who serve most faithfully, are first to fall!</p>
<p>⋯</p>
<p>Can you imagine what my feelings were?</p>
<p>Like those of anyone in such a case:</p>
<p>I hated life and longed to share the fate</p>
<p>of my own kind, for everywhere I looked</p>
<p>the dead were strewn in heaps, without distinction,</p>
<p>like rotten apples shaken from the bough</p>
<p>or acorns that the wind strips from an oak.</p>
<p>⋯</p>
<p>Some freed themselves from the fear they had of death</p>
<p>by taking their own lives—summoning Fate</p>
<p>even as Fate prepared to summon them.</p>
<p>No longer were the bodies of the dead</p>
<p>carried in processions from the city</p>
<p>for burial with the customary rites:</p>
<p>no gates were wide enough for such a throng.</p>
<p>Either they lay unburied on the ground</p>
<p>or, without services, were stacked and burned;</p>
<p>and now there are no honors for the dead;</p>
<p>dying, men struggle over scraps of wood,</p>
<p>and are cremated with a stranger’s flame.</p>
<p>With none to mourn them, unlamented souls</p>
<p>of parents and their children, the young, the old,</p>
<p>wander about, their journey uncompleted:</p>
<p>no wood is left to burn their bodies now,</p>
<p>no bit of land where they may be interred.”</p>
</blockquote>

## Book VIII

The book opens with the story of Scylla, who like Medea, betrays her family and country after falling in love with a man:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“Love has led me</p>
<p>into this betrayal; I am Scylla,</p>
<p>the daughter of King Nisus; I surrender</p>
<p>myself, my nation, and my gods as well,</p>
<p>and seek no other recompense but you;</p>
<p>receive this pledge that guarantees my love,</p>
<p>this purple lock—which is no lock at all,</p>
<p>but my father’s head!” She stretched out her foul hand</p>
<p>with the proffered gift as Minos shrank away,</p>
<p>shocked by the sight of this unholy act:</p>
<p>“Shame of the age,” he said, “may the gods forbid you</p>
<p>their kingdom, and may land and sea deny you!</p>
<p>Be sure that I will never let so vile</p>
<p>a monster into Crete”</p>
</blockquote>

It is hard to imagine a woman falling in love with a man she hasn’t met and cutting her head off. Ovid’s portrayal of women’s sexual passion feels like pornographic male fantasy.

Ironically, when Minos returns to Crete, he realizes his wife had slept with a bull, letting a vile monster onto Crete.

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>The scandal of his family had grown</p>
<p>past all concealment; now the mother’s foul</p>
<p>adultery was proven by the strange</p>
<p>form of the Minotaur, half man, half bull.</p>
<p>Minos determined to remove the cause</p>
<p>of this opprobrium from his abode,</p>
<p>enclosing it within a labyrinth</p>
<p>devised and built by Daedalus, the most</p>
<p>distinguished of all living architects,</p>
<p>who framed confusion and seduced the eye</p>
<p>into a maze of wandering passages.</p>
<p>Not otherwise than when Maeander pays</p>
<p>his liquid games in the Phrygian fields</p>
<p>and flowing back and forth uncertainly,</p>
<p>observes its own waves bearing down on it,</p>
<p>and sends its doubtful waters on their ways</p>
<p>back to their source of down to the open sea:</p>
<p>so Daedalus provided numberless</p>
<p>confusing corridors and was himself</p>
<p>just barely able to find his way out,</p>
<p>so utterly deceitful was that place.</p>
</blockquote>

Daedalus builds wings and flees Crete with his son Icarus, who famously dies because he flies too close to the sun. I love these lines, describing bystanders watching:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Some fisherman whose line jerks with his catch,</p>
<p>some idle shepherd leaning on his crook,</p>
<p>some plowman at his plow, looks up and sees</p>
<p>something astonishing, and thinks them gods,</p>
<p>who have the power to pass through the air.</p>
</blockquote>

Daedalus is brilliant, but he also demonstrates terrible academic jealousy:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>For, as it happened, the inventor’s sister,</p>
<p>quite unaware of what the Fates intended,</p>
<p>entrusted her own son to his instruction,</p>
<p>a likely lad of twelve, who had a mind</p>
<p>with the capacity for principles and precepts;</p>
<p>and from his observation of the spines</p>
<p>of fishes, which he’d taken as his model,</p>
<p>incised a row of teeth in an iron strip</p>
<p>and thereby managed to invent the saw.</p>
<p>Likewise, he was the first to bind two arms</p>
<p>of iron at a joint, so one is fixed</p>
<p>and the other, as it moves, inscribes a circle.</p>
<p>Daedalus envied him, and headlong hurled</p>
<p>this lad of precepts from a precipice,</p>
<p>the steep acropolis Minerva loves,</p>
<p>and lying, said the lad had slipped and fallen.</p>
</blockquote>

When the apostle Paul visits Athens, he stood in front of the Areopagus, and said “Athenians, I see how extremely religious you are in every way. For as I went through the city and looked carefully at the objects of your worship, I found among them an altar with the inscription, ‘To an unknown god.’” I wonder if pagans worshiped the unknown god to ensure they aren’t forgetting to sacrifice to a god they are not aware of. The jealous anger of the pagan gods is common, here is a nice example:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Commencing with the rural deities,</p>
<p>the gods all got the honors they desired;</p>
<p>only Diana’s altar was ignored,</p>
<p>and left, they say, without a gift of incense.</p>
<p>Even the gods may be provoked to anger!</p>
<p>“We will not let them get away with this,”</p>
<p>Diana said, “Dishonored we may be;</p>
<p>but none will say that we were unavenged!”</p>
<p>And the spurned goddess sent her vengeful boar</p>
<p>straightway onto the fields of Calydon:</p>
<p>a beat as great as the bulls of Epirus,</p>
<p>and mightier than those of Sicily,</p>
<p>with blood and fire shining from his eyes</p>
<p>and a neck stiff with bristles just like spear shafts;</p>
<p>and as his chest heaved with his grating breast,</p>
<p>his heavy shoulders dripped with seething spume;</p>
<p>in length his tusks were like an elephant’s,</p>
<p>and bolts of lightning issued from his mouth,</p>
<p>and when he exhaled, trees turned black and died.</p>
</blockquote>

A band of heroes, including Nestor from the _Iliad_ and Jason of the Golden Fleece, sets out the kill the boar. A few heroes die, and after a fortunate spear ends its life, the heroes bicker over the honors of the dead. One tragedy leads to another, and before long Diana has completed her revenge. Ovid says:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Not even if some god had given me</p>
<p>a hundred mouths, each fitted with a tongue,</p>
<p>and genius suitable to the occasion,</p>
<p>and all of Helicon for inspiration,</p>
<p>not even then would I be able to</p>
<p>describe the sad fate of his wretched sisters,</p>
<p>who, careless of decorum, beat their breasts,</p>
<p>and while his corpse was still displayed among them,</p>
<p>caressed him constantly and gave him kisses,</p>
<p>and even kissed the bier he was laid out on</p>
</blockquote>

Some of the heroes, upon their journey home from the hunt, are stopped at the overflowing river Acheloüs. They tell stories with the river to pass the time, including the story of some naiads turned into islands and my favourite story of Baucis and Philemon. Two gods in disguise look for a home to stay in. Many turn them down, but the old couple lets them in and, though pour, try to make them comfortable. The scene seems archetypal—disguised gods testing the devout (consider Abraham being visited by divine messengers).

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“The gods reclined. And with her skirts hitched up,</p>
<p>the trembling old lady set the table,</p>
<p>correcting its imbalance with a potsherd</p>
<p>slipped underneath the shortest of its legs;</p>
<p>and when the table had been stabilized,</p>
<p>she scrubbed its surface clean with fragrant mint.”</p>
</blockquote>

The visitors magically refill the winebowl, and the couple realize they are gods.

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“They had a single goose, the guardian</p>
<p>of their small villa, whom they now prepared</p>
<p>to sacrifice to their immortal guests;</p>
<p>his swiftness, though, left the old pair exhausted.</p>
<p>Time after time, he slipped out of their grasp,</p>
<p>and then, it seemed, sought refuge with the gods,</p>
<p>who would not let the couple do him in”</p>
</blockquote>

The small expressions Ovid uses, like “the guardian of their small villa,” let one imagine the scene with so few words.

The gods destroy the town (similar to Sodom and Gomorrah), and ask the old couple what reward they want.

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“‘We ask to be allowed to guard your temple</p>
<p>as its priests, and, since we have lived together</p>
<p>so many years in harmony, we ask</p>
<p>that the same hour take us both together,</p>
<p>and that I should not live to see her tomb</p>
<p>nor she survive to bury me in min.’”</p>
</blockquote>

Acheloüs tells the story of Erysichton, who chopped down a sacred tree of Ceres, who soon sent famine to enact her revenge. Erysichton was so hungry he sold his daughter into slavery and eventually ate himself to death:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“But when at last his illness had consumed</p>
<p>all that she brought him, and he still craved more,</p>
<p>the wretched man began to tear his limbs</p>
<p>asunder, mangling them in his maw,</p>
<p>and fed his body as he shrank away.”</p>
</blockquote>

## Book IX

Hercules’ contempt of death, and the Greek ideal:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>And as the eager flames began to spread,</p>
<p>you draped the pelt of the Nemean lion</p>
<p>over the top, and pillowing your head</p>
<p>upon your club, you lay there at your ease,</p>
<p>not otherwise than as you would have been</p>
<p>reclining at a banquet, flower-wreathed,</p>
<p>with wine to drink from cups always refilled.</p>
<p>Now spreading out in every direction,</p>
<p>the crackling flames came after Hercules,</p>
<p>whose carefree limbs received them with contempt.</p>
</blockquote>

Since its lines contain little advice or philosophical insight, I read the _Metamorphoses_ primarily for their beauty and to know the myths referenced so often in paintings and later literature. Ovid’s psychological portrayals of tempted individuals, while maybe not realistic, have made me more empathetic. Media, Scylla, Byblis, and Myrrah—all lusting women, perhaps a weird obsession of Ovid—in particular are interesting. Here are a few quotes from the story of Byblis, who fell in love with her brother, demonstrating how her passion developed:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Her feelings for him gradually changed,</p>
<p>and not for the better; when she visited</p>
<p>her brother, she was elegantly dressed,</p>
<p>and anxious that he find her beautiful,</p>
<p>and envious of those who seemed more lovely.</p>
<p>She was, as yet, unconscious of her feelings,</p>
<p>and offered up no prayers for satisfaction,</p>
<p>but burned with inner fire, nonetheless.</p>
<p>She calls him “Master” now, and now detests</p>
<p>the thought that they are siblings, and prefers</p>
<p>that he should call her “Byblis” and not “Sister.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“But even if I keep them out of mind,</p>
<p>there is no wrong in <em>dreaming</em> of such things</p>
<p>as often as I want to, in my sleep!</p>
<p>There are no witnesses to our dreams,</p>
<p>and they provide a pleasure almost real!</p>
<p>“O Cupid and sweet Venus, what great joys</p>
<p>were given me! And how real they seemed!</p>
<p>My marrow melted as I lay asleep!</p>
<p>How pleasing to remember! But how brief</p>
<p>those pleasures were–the night, with breakneck speed,</p>
<p>snatched them away, when they had just begun!”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“The sons of Aeolus were not afraid</p>
<p>to sleep with their sisters! How do I know this,</p>
<p>and why have I come up with this example?</p>
<p>Where is this leading me? Depart, indecent thoughts,</p>
<p>and let me love my brother not at all,</p>
<p>unless my move is sisterly and lawful!”</p>
</blockquote>

When her brother avoids her advances by fleeing to found a colony, Byblis goes insane and, crying in despair, is morphed into a spring.

The last story in this chapter is relevant for me, since my wife is pregant with a baby girl:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>For, once upon a time, there lived in Phaestus</p>
<p>a freeborn plebeian named Ligdus, who</p>
<p>was otherwise unknown and undistinguished,</p>
<p>with no more property than fame or status,</p>
<p>and yet devout, and blameless in his life.</p>
<p>His wife was pregnant. When her time had come,</p>
<p>he gave her his instructions with these words:</p>
<p>“There are two things I pray to heaven for</p>
<p>on your account: an easy birth and a son.</p>
<p>The other fate is much too burdensome,</p>
<p>for daughters need what Fortune has denied us:</p>
<p>a dowry. Therefore—and may God prevent</p>
<p>this happening, but if, by chance, it does</p>
<p>and you should be delivered of a girl,</p>
<p>unwillingly I order this, and beg</p>
<p>pardon for my impiety—<em>But let it die!</em>”</p>
<p>He spoke, and tears profusely bathed the cheeks</p>
<p>of the instructor and instructed both.</p>
<p>Telethusa continued to implore</p>
<p>her husband, praying him not to confine</p>
<p>their hopes so narrowly—to no avail,</p>
<p>for he would not be moved from his decision.</p>
<p>Now scarcely able to endure the weight</p>
<p>of her womb’s burden, as she lay in bed</p>
<p>at midnight, a dream-vision came to her:</p>
<p>the goddess Io stood (or seemed to sand)</p>
<p>before her troubled bed, accompanied</p>
<p>with solemn pomp by her mysteries.</p>
</blockquote>

The relationship between man and woman is, as is usual, unequal.

Infanticide has apparently been practiced by many, if not most, cultures. In Roman society, the man of the household would inspect the baby. Sometimes it would be killed if thought to be illegitimate or, as in this story, they couldn’t afford a girl. (How far has our ethics progressed—probably due mostly to technological advances!)

As Ovid usually does, he portrays Ligdus in a good light and gives the reader some understanding of how he came to his decision.

Io informs Telthusa to keep the baby, even if it is a girl. It is, and they keep this fact a secret. She grows up, and is arranged to be married! She falls in love with the girl, a family friend. The story is amazing:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>And scarcely holding back her tears, she cries,</p>
<p>“Oh, what will be the end reserved for Iphis,</p>
<p>gripped by a strange and monstrous passion known</p>
<p>to no one else? If the gods had wished to spare me,</p>
<p>they should have; if they wanted to destroy me,</p>
<p>they should have given me a natural affliction.</p>
<p>Cows do not burn for cows, nor mares for mares;</p>
<p>the ram will have his sheep, the stag his does,</p>
<p>and birds will do the same when they assemble;</p>
<p>there are no animals whose females lust</p>
<p>for other females! I wish that I were dead!</p>
<p>That Crete might bring forth monsters of all kinds,</p>
<p>Queen Pasiphaë was taken by a bull,</p>
<p>yet even <em>that</em> was male-and-female passion!</p>
<p>My love is much less rational than hers,</p>
<p>to tell the truth. At least she had the hope</p>
<p>of satisfaction, taking in the bull</p>
<p>through guile, and in the image of a cow,</p>
<p>thereby deceiving the adulterer!</p>
<p>If every form of ingenuity</p>
<p>were gathered here from all around the world,</p>
<p>if Daedalus flew back on waxen wings,</p>
<p>what could he do? Could all his learnèd arts</p>
<p>transform me from a girl into a boy?</p>
<p>Or could <em>you</em> change into a boy, Ianthe?</p>
</blockquote>

Apparently, while male-male homosexuality was common in ancient Rome, female-female homosexuality was not.

Io turned Iphis into a boy at the last minute.

## Book X

Ovid economically relays the death of Orpheus’ wife, and how he descends to the underworld to ask for her back. After playing a song:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>These words, accompanied on the plucked strings,</p>
<p>so moved the bloodless spirits that they wept;</p>
<p>Tantalus did not seek the receding water,</p>
<p>and on his wheel lay Ixion, astounded;</p>
<p>the birds let go the liver, and the daughters</p>
<p>of Danaüs were resting by their urns,</p>
<p>while you, O Sisyphus, sat on your stone.</p>
</blockquote>

When an author relies on their audience being well-read, they can paint with great depth and speed by borrowing the images of others.

Hades allows Eurydice a second life, but tragically, Orpheus breaks the one condition and looks back at her before leaving the underworld. Ovid’s description is haunting and beautiful, but he quickly dispels the epic aura around the tale with:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Three times the Sun had finished out the year</p>
<p>in Pisces of the waters. Orpheus</p>
<p>had fled completely from the love of women,</p>
<p>either because it hadn’t worked for him</p>
<p>or else because the pledge that he had given</p>
<p>to his Eurydice was permanent;</p>
<p>no matter: women burned to have the bard,</p>
<p>and many suffered greatly from rejection.</p>
<p>Among the Thracians, he originated</p>
<p>the practice of transferring the affections</p>
<p>to youthful males, plucking the first flower</p>
<p>in the brief spring time of their early manhood.</p>
</blockquote>

The antecedent of “it” must be Orpheus’ penis, and Ovid casts doubt on motive for staying away from women, conjecturing that it wasn’t of his own choice, and for this reason he turned to young boys. Ovid’s lack of reverence is distasteful to me, even being so far separated from the cultural stories he denigrates—still, he is fun to read.

Orpheus proceeds to tell a number of stories, about gods loving boys and girls with unnatural lusts.

A quote from the story of Hyacinthus, makes light of a similar simile in the _Iliad_:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“As when a poppy or violet grown in a garden</p>
<p>among the lilies (whose tongues are thick yellow and bristly)</p>
<p>breaks, and the flower’s head shrivels, droops, and collapses,</p>
<p>unable to hold itself up, with downcast demeanor,</p>
<p>just so the dying boy’s head, now lacking all vigor,</p>
<p>unable to bear its own weight, lies flat on his shoulder.”</p>
</blockquote>

Here is the original:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>As a garden poppy, burst into red bloom, bends,</p>
<p>drooping its head to one side, weighed down</p>
<p>by its full seeds and a sudden spring shower,</p>
<p>so Gorgythion’s head fell limp over one shoulder,</p>
<p>weighed down by his helmet.</p>
<cite>— Iliad 8.306-9</cite>
</blockquote>

In Homer, a great hero has died; in Ovid, a boy-lover dies in a discus accident. Furthermore, Apollo says he will speak about Hyacinthus in his poetry!

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“‘You will be present both in my songs and mu music,</p>
<p>and a flower will come into being, inscribed with my mourning;</p>
<p>later, a legend involving the boldest of heroes</p>
<p>will be conjoined to this flower and read in its markings.’”</p>
</blockquote>

Orpheus then tells the story of Pygmallion, and how, after being repulsed by the “numerous defects of character Nature had given the feminine spirit,” he falls in love with his statue. Is Ovid demeaning women, or men when he tells of the ridiculous gifts Pygmallion brought:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>he seeks to win its affections with words and with presents</p>
<p>pleasing to girls, such as seashells and pebbles, tame birds,</p>
<p>armloads of flowers in thousands of different colors,</p>
<p>lilies, bright painted balls, curious insects in amber</p>
</blockquote>

Perhaps Ovid is using the classic story to make fun of men, for helplessly chasing women, and women for being shallowly bought by gifts.

Next Orpheus tells the story of Myrrha, who fell in love with her father and tricked him into sleeping with her. Ovid has the poet warn readers:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>I sing of dire events: depart from me, daughters,</p>
<p>depart from me, fathers; or, if you find my poems charming,</p>
<p>believe that I lie, believe these events never happened;</p>
<p>or, if you believe they did, then believe they were punished.</p>
</blockquote>

## Book XI

After telling stories for most of Book X, Orpheus is torn to pieces by the Maenads. This scene is one of my favorite:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Meanwhile, as Orpheus compelled the tress</p>
<p>and beasts to follow him with suchlike songs,</p>
<p>and made the very stones skip in his wake,</p>
<p>behold: a raving mob of Thracian women</p>
<p>with the pelts of wild beasts draped across their breasts</p>
<p>observed him from the summit of a hill</p>
<p>setting the words to music on his lyre.</p>
<p>One of them tossed her hair in the light breeze:</p>
<p>“Look over there!” she cried. “The one who scorns us!”</p>
<p>And with no more ado, she cast her lance</p>
<p>at the vocalizing mouth of Apollo’s seer;</p>
<p>it struck without wounding, being wreathed in leaves.</p>
<p>Another’s weapon was the stone she cast,</p>
<p>that even in midflight was overwhelmed</p>
<p>by words and music joined in harmony,</p>
<p>and, as though begging pardon for its mad daring,</p>
<p>fell at the poet’s feet.</p>
</blockquote>

Ovid’s commentary on Oracles:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>His brother’s transformation and some weird</p>
<p>portents that followed it left Ceyx perturbed</p>
<p>and eager to consult the oracles</p>
<p>that comfort men in their perplexity,</p>
<p>but on account of Phorbas and his brigands,</p>
<p>the road to Delphi was too dangerous,</p>
<p>so he prepared to undertake a journey</p>
<p>to Phoebus’ shrine at Clarium instead</p>
</blockquote>

Knowledge of the source of lightening:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>for once they break loose and reach open seas,</p>
<p>the winds are wholly uncontrollable,</p>
<p>and earth and sea alike are unprotected;</p>
<p>indeed, they even vex the clouds in heaven,</p>
<p>and shake the lightnings from them by collision!</p>
</blockquote>

I adore the story of Ceyx and Alcyone—a loving couple separated by death but both turned to birds. The description of Ceyx’s death at sea is some of Ovid’s most vivid. It includes a great simile:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Sails were rain-sodden, waters from above</p>
<p>were mixed in thoroughly with those below;</p>
<p>the stars were all put out, and blackest night</p>
<p>bore down with its own darkness and the storm’s.</p>
<p>That darkness, nonetheless, was shattered by</p>
<p>the flickering thunderbolts that lit the sky</p>
<p>and made the raindrops glitter as they fell.</p>
<p>Boldly the flood now sprang onto the ship,</p>
<p>and like a solider, who, surpassing all</p>
<p>his many comrades, in the last assault</p>
<p>upon the walls of a beleaguered city,</p>
<p>after so many tries, achieves his aim,</p>
<p>and, fired by the love of praise, leaps over,</p>
<p>and one man holds the wall against a thousand;</p>
<p>just so, when nine successive waves have battered</p>
<p>the hull of that tall ship without success,</p>
<p>the tenth wave rushes in with greater force,</p>
<p>and does not end its struggle with the weary</p>
<p>vessel before it penetrates the wall</p>
<p>of the captured ship.</p>
</blockquote>

## Book XII

The characteristic abodes of Envy, Sleep, and Rumor are described in the _Metamorphoses_. Rumor’s house is fun:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Crowds fill the entryway, a fickle mob</p>
<p>that comes and goes; and rumors everywhere,</p>
<p>thousands of fabrications mixed with fact,</p>
<p>wander the premises, while false reports</p>
<p>flit all about. Some fill their idle ears</p>
<p>with others’ words, and some go bearing tales</p>
<p>elsewhere, while everywhere the fictions grow,</p>
<p>as everyone adds on to what he’s heard.</p>
</blockquote>

Ovid enjoys making fun of Homer’s heroes. He begins withe Achilles’

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>The officers all took their ease, reclining</p>
<p>on couches where they stuffed themselves with meat</p>
<p>and drove away their cares and thirst with wine.</p>
<p>No lyres for this lot, no poetry,</p>
<p>no flutes of boxwood, pierced with many holes:</p>
<p>what pleases them is to extend the night</p>
<p>by telling stories of heroic deeds;</p>
<p>they reenact old wars, their own and others,</p>
<p>and are delighted to remember all</p>
<p>the dangers they’ve endured and gotten through:</p>
<p>what else has great Achilles to discuss?</p>
<p>What else is there to speak of in his presence?</p>
</blockquote>

Next in line is Nestor, who even Homer seemed to poke fun at a bit:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Nestor replied: “Though my extreme old age</p>
<p>is something of an obstacle to me,</p>
<p>and much of what I witnessed in my youth</p>
<p>I have forgotten, still I remember much,</p>
<p>and nothing stands out more in memory,</p>
<p>among so many acts of war and peace,</p>
<p>than this does. But if great expanse of years</p>
<p>makes one a living witness of so much</p>
<p>that happened, I have lived two centuries</p>
<p>already, and am living in my third!”</p>
</blockquote>

And then there is the ridiculous death descriptions:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“They eyes leapt forth</p>
<p>from the disfigured pudding of his face,</p>
<p>and his nose was driven back into his palate.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“He plunged the horns into Gryneus’ eyes</p>
<p>and gouged them out; one to an antler clung,</p>
<p>the other dribbled down his beard and hung</p>
<p>suspended in a mass of clotting gore.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“and Dictys, as he fled Pirithoüs</p>
<p>in fearful haste, toppled over the edge</p>
<p>of a mountain with two peaks, plunging headlong</p>
<p>until a giant ash tree broke his fall,</p>
<p>and left its fractured branches decorated</p>
<p>with loops of his intestines.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“and used his sword to open up his belly;</p>
<p>that fierce, unbridled beast bounded forward</p>
<p>and spilled his entrails out upon the ground,</p>
<p>and what spilled out of him, he trod upon,</p>
<p>and what was trodden on was burst asunder</p>
<p>and tangled in his legs until he fell,</p>
<p>his belly emptied of its viscera.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“shattered the broad dome of his skull, and pressed</p>
<p>his fluid brains till they exuded through</p>
<p>his mouth, his sinuses, his eyes and ears,</p>
<p>as when the whey pours through the oaken basket</p>
<p>leaving the curds behind, or as when grapes</p>
<p>beneath the press drip through the slender sieve,</p>
<p>and juice is squeezed out through the narrow openings.”</p>
</blockquote>

Ovid includes the sequences of deaths, like Homer:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“And with that club, he flattened Nedymnus</p>
<p>and Lycopes, skilled with the javelin,</p>
<p>and Hippasos, whose breast was covered by</p>
<p>his uncut beard, and Ripheus, who loomed</p>
<p>above the tallest tress, and Thereus,</p>
<p>who caught bears on the peaks of Thessaly</p>
<p>and fetched them back still living and indignant.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“Caeneus had already slaughtered five:</p>
<p>Styphelus first, then Bromus, Antimachus,</p>
<p>Elymus, and axe-wielding Pyracmos;</p>
<p>I don’t recall the manner of their deaths,</p>
<p>for I took note just of the names and numbers.”</p>
</blockquote>

He pokes fun at the Greek’s armor obsession:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Achilles very shield—that you should be aware</p>
<p>whose it once was—now instigates a battle,</p>
<p>and for his arms, arms are now taken up.</p>
</blockquote>

He even makes fun of the role the gods played in Homer, perhaps questioning their existence:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“and when he saw the [thrown tree] coming, Theseus</p>
<p>moved out of range, upon advice of Pallas—</p>
<p>or so he would prefer us to believe.”</p>
</blockquote>

Many stories’ central metamorphosis is physical, in the story of Achilles death, the change is of a living man into a legacy:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>now he is ashes: and the little left</p>
<p>of great Achilles scarcely fills an urn,</p>
<p>although his living glory fills the world.</p>
<p>That glory is the measure of the man,</p>
<p>and it is this that is Achilles’ essence,</p>
<p>nor does he feel the emptiness of death.</p>
</blockquote>

## Book XIII

Ajax and Ulysses proclaim to the Greek assembly why they should receive Achilles’ shield.

Ajax’ has a few funny arguments:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“I realize I seek a great reward,</p>
<p>but having such a rival is demeaning</p>
<p>and cheats me of the honor I am due:</p>
<p>Ajax cannot be proud to win a prize,</p>
<p>no matter how substantial, that Ulysses</p>
<p>can have the expectation of receiving;</p>
<p>he has already gotten his reward,</p>
<p>for when his claim has been rejected, he</p>
<p>can boast that he and I were fairly matched!”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“In truth, if I may say so, it’s the prize</p>
<p>that seeks association with <em>my</em> glory,</p>
<p>and would be honored much more than would I—</p>
<p>for it’s the armor would be given Ajax,</p>
<p>not Ajax the armor.”</p>
</blockquote>

Ulysses wins; his central argument is that his intellect is more important than fighting prowess. He also pulls the jury to his side by emotionally aligning them against Ajax:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“Nor should it shock us that his [Ajax’] stupid mouth</p>
<p>should so abuse me, for you also are</p>
<p>the targets of his indecent reproaches.</p>
<p>Can it be baseness for me to accuse</p>
<p>Palamedes unjustly, but correct</p>
<p>for you to find him guilty of the charges?”</p>
</blockquote>

The story of the Cyclops, Polyphemus from the _Odyssey_, wooing Galatea is hilarious. Ovid, as he always does, masterfully ridicules without indulging too much. Thus, Polyphemus’ advances are funny yet not crude. Here are a few of my favorite lines:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“‘O Galatea, whiter than the snowy white</p>
<p>flowers that decorate the privet hedge,</p>
<p>richer in blossoms than the meadow is,</p>
<p>taller, more slender than an alder tree,</p>
<p>brighter than crystal, more skittish than a kid,</p>
<p>smoother than a seashell on the shore</p>
<p>worn by the ceaseless motion of the waves,</p>
<p>more pleasing than the shade in summertime</p>
<p>or sun in winter, swifter than the deer,</p>
<p>and even more remarkable to see,</p>
<p>far more conspicuous than the tall plane tree;</p>
<p>clearer than ice, sweeter than ripe grapes,</p>
<p>software than swans’ down or the curdled milk,</p>
<p>and, of you would not always flee from me,</p>
<p>more beautiful than an irrigated garden.</p>
<p>Yet you, the very selfsame Galatea,</p>
<p>are fiercer than an untamed heifer is,</p>
<p>harder than oak, more feigning than the sea,</p>
<p>tougher than willow wands or bryony,</p>
<p>less movable than the rock I’m sitting on,</p>
<p>rougher than rapids, prouder than a peacock,</p>
<p>fiercer than fire, bitterer than thistles,</p>
<p>grumpier than a nursing mother-bear,</p>
<p>more unresponsive even than the ocean,</p>
<p>less apt to pity than a stepped-on snake’”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“‘Just look how big I am! Not even Jove—</p>
<p>this Jupiter that you go on about,</p>
<p>who you say governs heaven—is as big!</p>
<p>Abundant hair hangs over my fierce face</p>
<p>and shoulders, shading me, just like a grove;</p>
<p>but don’t think me unsightly just because</p>
<p>I am completely covered in dense bristles:</p>
<p>unsightly is the tree that has no leaves,</p>
<p>the horse without a mane; birds have their plumage</p>
<p>and sheep are most attractive in their wool,</p>
<p>so facial hair and a full body beard</p>
<p>are really most becoming in a man.</p>
<p>In the middle of my forehead is one eye,</p>
<p>as large in its appearance as a shield:</p>
<p>what of it, then? Does not the mighty Sun</p>
<p>see everything that happens here on earth?</p>
<p>And as for eyes, he too has only one!”</p>
</blockquote>

The Metropolitan Museum of Art has an original Roman painting, one of the rare survivors, from around the time of Ovid (if I recall). The painting depicts a few scenes of the Polymphemus and Galatea story.

The story about Glaucas eating magical grass which turns him into a fish is a bizarre (beside the teeth turning into men, in the Jason and Cadmus stories, who then fight one another, this may be the oddest story in the _Metamorphoses_, although I am not sure I could point out why. Perhaps many of the other stories in Ovid would sound odd too, if our culture had not appropriated them. When I read Chinese (or even some Egyptian) stories, they all sound as odd as this one. But the opposite is likely true too.

Here is the especially odd part:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“Now comes what sounds like fiction, I admit,</p>
<p>but what advantage would I gain by feigning?</p>
<p>Lying on the grass, my plunder from the surf</p>
<p>began to stir, and flipped from side to side,</p>
<p>as all at once, they strove to leave the earth</p>
<p>and get back to the water. While I watched,</p>
<p>dumbfounded and incapable of moving,</p>
<p>they fled, the lot of them, abandoning</p>
<p>the shore and their new master for the sea.</p>
<p>I stood stock-still in wonder a long time,</p>
<p>asking myself how such a thing could be;</p>
<p>was it some god—or something in the grass?</p>
<p>‘How could mere grass,’ I asked, ‘be strong as that?’</p>
<p>I plucked some and ground it in my teeth,</p>
<p>and scarcely had I gulped that unknown liquid,</p>
<p>when suddenly my heart began to pound,</p>
<p>and my whole sensibility was taken</p>
<p>with the desire for another element,</p>
<p>which I could not resist for long: ‘Farewell,</p>
<p>O earth, which I will nevermore return to,’</p>
<p>I said, and plunged beneath the ocean’s waves.”</p>
</blockquote>

## Book XIV

Glaucus, in love with Scylla, asks Circe to help. Instead, she falls in love with him:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“I pray you will have me! Only spurn</p>
<p>the one who spurns your passion, and return</p>
<p>the love of one who loves you: let one deed serve</p>
<p>two women as they each of them deserve.”</p>
<p>Glaucus responded to her proposition:</p>
<p>“The leaves of trees will spring out of the ocean,</p>
<p>and seaweed will be found on mountain ranges,</p>
<p>before my love for Scylla ever changes.”</p>
</blockquote>

And so, Circe transforms Syclla into a monster:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“her private parts deformed into the shapes</p>
<p>of barking dogs …</p>
<p>Her lover Glaucus wept at this and fled</p>
<p>from having any more to do with Circe,</p>
<p>whose use of potent herbs was too aggressive.”</p>
</blockquote>

Diomedes recounting the woes of the returning Greeks:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“I will not long delay you, setting out</p>
<p>our woes in the order they occurred:</p>
<p>just say that even Priam would have wept</p>
<p>to see how Greece was fairing at that time!”</p>
</blockquote>

Anaxarete, after spurning Iphis’ advances, sees his body and is turned to stone:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“scarcely had she glimpsed</p>
<p>the corpse of Iphis laid out on his bier,</p>
<p>when her eyes hardened and he cold blood ran</p>
<p>in terror from her body: she attempted</p>
<p>to step back from the sight, but her feet froze;</p>
<p>when she attempted to avert her face,</p>
<p>she was unable to; and very soon</p>
<p>the stoniness that for so long a time</p>
<p>had been within her heart spread through her body.”</p>
</blockquote>

## Book XV

Pythagoras’ pagan skepticism:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>lightning is produced by Jove</p>
<p>or by the winds that tear apart the clouds;</p>
<p>what causes earthquakes and what keeps the stars</p>
<p>from flying off, and other hidden things</p>
</blockquote>

Pythagoras on being vegetarian:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“Mortals, refrain from defiling your bodies with sinful</p>
<p>feasting, for you have the fruits of the earth and of arbors,</p>
<p>whose branches bow with their burden; for you the grapes ripen,</p>
<p>for you the delicious greens are made tender by cooking;</p>
<p>milk is permitted you too, and thyme-scented honey:</p>
<p>Earth is abundantly wealthy and freely provides you</p>
<p>her gentle sustenance, offered without any bloodshed.</p>
<p>Some of the beasts <em>do</em> eat flesh to allay their own hunger,</p>
<p>although not all of them, for horses, sheep, and cattle</p>
<p>feed upon grasses; but those of untameable nature—</p>
<p>Armenian tigers, furious lions, wolves and bears, too—</p>
<p>these creatures take pleasure in feasting on what they have slaughtered.</p>
<p>What an indecency, mingling entrails with entrails,</p>
<p>fattening one on the flesh from another one’s body,</p>
<p>saving the life of one by another’s destruction!”</p>
</blockquote>

Pythagoras on the afterlife and fear thereof:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“O people stunned with the icy terror of dying,</p>
<p>why do you fear the Styx? Why are you frightened of phantoms</p>
<p>and names that mean nothing, the empty blather of poets,</p>
<p>foolish hobgoblins of a world that never existed?</p>
<p>Here is what happens after you die: your body,</p>
<p>whether consumed on the pyre of slowly decaying,</p>
<p>suffers no evil; souls cannot perish, and always,</p>
<p>on leaving their prior abodes, they come to new ones,</p>
<p>living on, dwelling again in receptive bodies”</p>
</blockquote>

Pythagoras on unending change:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“And since I am already embarked upon this great sea,</p>
<p>have given full sails to the wind, hear me out: nothing</p>
<p>endures in this world! The whole of it flows, and all is</p>
<p>formed with a changing appearance; even time passes,</p>
<p>constant in motion no different from a great river,</p>
<p>for neither a river nor a transitory hour</p>
<p>is able to stand still; but just as each wave is driven</p>
<p>ahead by another, urged on from behind, and urging</p>
<p>the next wave before it in an unbroken sequence,</p>
<p>so the times flee and at the same time they follow,</p>
<p>and always are new; for what has just been is no longer,</p>
<p>and what has not been will presently come into being,</p>
<p>and every moment’s occasion is a renewal.”</p>
</blockquote>

Pythagoras on geology, and the changing planet:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“I truly believe that nothing may keep the same image</p>
<p>for a long time; the age of gold yields to iron,</p>
<p>and often places will know a reversal of fortune.</p>
<p>For with my own eyes, I have seen land that once was quite solid</p>
<p>change into water, and I have seen land made from ocean;</p>
<p>seashells have been discovered far from the seashore,</p>
<p>and rusty anchors right on the summits of mountains;</p>
<p>a former plain was converted into a valley</p>
<p>by rushing waters, whose force has leveled great mountains;</p>
<p>and a onetime marshland has been turned into a desert,</p>
<p>while thirsty sands have been transformed into marshland.”</p>
</blockquote>

Pythagoras on biological change:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“Mud contains seeds which generate frogs, at first legless,</p>
<p>though soon they develop limbs that equip them for swimming,</p>
<p>and so that these same limbs can be used for long-distance leaping,</p>
<p>their hind legs are always much greater in length than their forelegs.</p>
<p>Nor is the bear cub, when newly brought forth by the she-bear,</p>
<p>other than bear-pulp: by her own purposeful licking,</p>
<p>the mother bear shapes it and forms it in her own image.</p>
<p>Do you not see how the larva of bees, makers of honey,</p>
<p>so well protected within their hexagonal chambers</p>
<p>of wax, are born without any limbs on their bodies,</p>
<p>and only later develop legs and the wings used for flying?”</p>
</blockquote>

Pythagoras on the shifts of power:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“as one nation gains in strength while another collapses:</p>
<p>once Troy was great, rich in its wealth and its heroes,</p>
<p>and able to go on bleeding both for ten years;</p>
<p>now brought to earth, she has nothing to show but her ruins,</p>
<p>no wealth besides that which lies in her burial chambers.</p>
<p>Sparta was famous, mighty Mycenae once flourished,</p>
<p>even as Athens, even as Thebes of the Towers;</p>
<p>Sparta is worthless now, lofty Mycenae has toppled,</p>
<p>what but the name remains of the Thebes of Oedipus?</p>
<p>What but the name remains of Pandion’s Athens?”</p>
</blockquote>

Ovid pandering to Augustus:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>That one approached our altars as a stranger,</p>
<p>but Caesar is a god in his own city,</p>
<p>raised up to heaven, changed into a star</p>
<p>blazing so brilliantly, not by his own</p>
<p>remarkable success in war and peace,</p>
<p>not by the battles that were crowned in triumph,</p>
<p>nor by his service to the commonwealth,</p>
<p>nor yet by glory that hastened to his side;</p>
<p>but rather by his offspring, for no deed</p>
<p>has Caesar done that stands out more than this:</p>
<p>he is thew father of our own Augustus!</p>
</blockquote>

Ovid predicts his enduring fame:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>My work is finished now: no wrath of Jove</p>
<p>nor sword nor fire nor futurity</p>
<p>is capable of laying waste to it.</p>
<p>Let that day come then, when it wishes to,</p>
<p>which only has my body in its power,</p>
<p>and put an end to my uncertain years;</p>
<p>no matter, for in spirit I will be</p>
<p>borne up to soar beyond the distant stars,</p>
<p>immortal in the name I leave behind;</p>
<p>wherever Roman governance extends</p>
<p>over the subject nations of the world,</p>
<p>my words will be upon the people’s lips,</p>
<p>and if there is truth in poets’ prophesies,</p>
<p>then in my fame forever I will live.</p>
</blockquote>

## Metaphysics

The _Metamorphoses_ were meant to be entertaining, thus it is dangerous to make any theological conclusions from them. Still, some metaphysical comments may represent widely held beliefs from Ovid’s time. For example, the role of fate, present in Homer, is laid out:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Each of the gods there had a favorite,</p>
<p>and argued from a partisan position</p>
<p>against the others, until Jove spoke up:</p>
<p>“O gods! If you have any reverence</p>
<p>for us at all, why leap to such confusions?</p>
<p>Does anyone here imagine himself able</p>
<p>to overcome the limits set by Fate?</p>
<p>Iolaüs was given back the years</p>
<p>he was in need of by the will of Fate;</p>
<p>not by ambition, not by skill in combat</p>
<p>will Callirhoë’s sons turn into men</p>
<p>from infancy, but by the will of Fate,</p>
<p>which governs even us; I tell you this</p>
<p>that you might put a better face on it—</p>
<p>yes, <em>you</em> are ruled by Fate, and <em>I</em> am too.” <cite>(9.619–35)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Her [Venus’] father said, “My dear, are you preparing</p>
<p>to alter his [Ceasars’] inevitable fate</p>
<p>all by yourself? It is permitted you</p>
<p>to enter the Hall of Records kept by the Fates;</p>
<p>there you will find the labor of the ages,</p>
<p>the universal script, in bronze and iron,</p>
<p>which does not fear that clashes in the sky</p>
<p>or lightning’s rage will bring it down to ruin,</p>
<p>for it will be eternally secure.</p>
<p>Here you will find, inscribed on adamant</p>
<p>that will not perish ever, your son’s fate:</p>
<p>and I myself have read and noted it,</p>
<p>and I will now expound on it to you,</p>
<p>so you may understand what is to come.” <cite>(15.1004–17)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

Mortals had “deficits” that needed to be purged before becoming immortal:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“The sea god welcomed me, pronounced me fit</p>
<p>to join their honorable company,</p>
<p>and asked the Ocean and his consort, Tethys,</p>
<p>to take away whatever still remained</p>
<p>of my mortality; and this they did</p>
<p>first, by the recital of a hymn, nine times,</p>
<p>to purge me of my evil; then they bade</p>
<p>me to immerse myself a hundred times</p>
<p>in just as many rivers” <cite>(13.1378–86)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>She [Venus] bade the river god to take Aeneas</p>
<p>under the surface of his silent stream</p>
<p>and cleanse him of all mortal deficits;</p>
<p>he did as she commanded, bathing him,</p>
<p>and having purged him of this mortal dross,</p>
<p>restored his best, immortal part to him.</p>
<p>His mother purified Aeneas’ body,</p>
<p>anointing it with heavenly perfumes,</p>
<p>and touched his lips with sweet ambrosia</p>
<p>and nectar both, so he became a god, <cite>(14.861–72)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

The gods are limited in a number of ways. Interestingly, Ovid mentions that gods can’t undue actions of other gods:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Venus alone knew that the bolt had fallen</p>
<p>and would have put it back and locked the gates,</p>
<p>but one god is unable to rescind</p>
<p>the actions of another.</p>
</blockquote>

This sort of question is unique to polytheism.

## Epistemology

Ovid does not appear to take the myths he is telling seriously. Throughout the poem, he inserts comic asides. Here I present a few illustrative examples.

Ovid avoids stating which god created the universe:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Some god (or kinder nature) settled this</p>
<p>dispute by separating earth from heaven</p>
<p>⋯</p>
<p>Now when that god (whichever one it was)</p>
<p>had given Chaos form <cite>(1.26–41)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

He slyly implies that we do not know the source of some stories firsthand:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>So that the skies above might be no more</p>
<p>secure than earth, the race of Giants plotted</p>
<p>(we hear) to rule in heaven by themselves <cite>(1.205–8)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

Here he ironically says we have a story on good faith:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>(you needn’t take this part of it on faith,</p>
<p>for it’s supported by an old tradition)—</p>
<p>these stones at once begin to lose their hardness</p>
<p>and their rigidity; slowly they soften;</p>
<p>once softened, they begin to take on shapes. <cite>(1.556–60)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

In other places, he speculates about the gods motives:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>He spoke and threw his arms around her neck,</p>
<p>imploring her upon his very life,</p>
<p>and on that of his stepfather, Merops,</p>
<p>and by the wedding torches of his sisters,</p>
<p>to give him proof of who his father was.</p>
<p>Clymene, moved by Phaêthon’s petition</p>
<p>(or by the insult to her own good name), <cite>(1.1055–64)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

He openly questions the plausibility of the stories and the gods:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Her [Semele’s] child was torn out of her womb unfinished</p>
<p>and—this part is scarcely credible—was sewn</p>
<p>into his father’s thigh, where he was brought to term. <cite>(3.400-2)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>She has a virgin’s face, and, if our poets</p>
<p>are not to be completely disbelieved <cite>(13.1063–4)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“but war continued,</p>
<p>since both sides each had gods supporting them,</p>
<p>and courage, which is just as good as gods” <cite>(14.811–3)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

## Structure

The _Metamorphoses_’ Stories flow together roughly following time, but not completely. For example, Atlas is said to be carrying the world on his shoulders in book II but does not receive his burden until book IV, and Hercules’ apotheosis occurs in book IX but he is present during the sack of Troy in book XI.

Stories are often grouped together by family (the Cadmus stories in books III and IV) or by region (the Anatolian stories in book VI).

Nested stories at two or three levels are common (on occasion, as with the Arethusa and Alpheus in book V, four levels are present).

The connections between stories are often weak, for example:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Rumor might very well have spread the news</p>
<p>of this unprecedented transformation [of Byblis into a spring]</p>
<p>throughout the hundred towns of Crete, if they</p>
<p>had not just had a wonder of their own</p>
<p>to talk about—the change that came to Iphis. <cite>(9.960–4)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

## Similes

Apollo’s sudden love for Daphne:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Now just as in a field the harvest stubble</p>
<p>is all burned off, or as hedges are set ablaze</p>
<p>when, if by chance, some careless traveler</p>
<p>should brush one with his torch or toss away</p>
<p>the still-smoldering brand at break of day—</p>
<p>just so the smitten god went up in flames</p>
<p>until his heart was utterly afire,</p>
<p>and hope sustained his unrequited passion. <cite>(1.678–85)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

Apollo chasing Daphne, after being unable to woo her:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>But the young god had no further interest</p>
<p>in wasting his fine words on her; admonished</p>
<p>by his own passion, he accelerates,</p>
<p>and runs as swiftly as a Gallic hound</p>
<p>chasing a rabbit through an open field;</p>
<p>the one seeks shelter and the other, prey—</p>
<p>he clings to her, is just about to spring,</p>
<p>with his long muzzle straining at her heels,</p>
<p>while she, not knowing whether she’s been caught,</p>
<p>in one swift burst, eludes those snapping jaws,</p>
<p>no longer the anticipated feast;</p>
<p>so he in hope and she in terror race. <cite>(1.732–44)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

## Rape

Aeacus’s casual comment about his wife being worthy:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“Her name was Procris: it’s likelier you’ve heard</p>
<p>about her ravished sister, Orithyia,</p>
<p>but were you to compare the two of them</p>
<p>in looks and manner, Procris was more worthy</p>
<p>of being ravished!” <cite>(6.990–5)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

Sometimes the raped women seem to be proud that they attracted the gods and have semi-divine offspring, but, if their flights are not evidence enough of their unwillingness, then Ovid makes it clear other times:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“And after Neptune had taken his delight</p>
<p>by ravishing the maiden, he announced,</p>
<p>‘Whatever you desire will be granted!</p>
<p>Fear no refusal; ask and it is given.’</p>
<p>Caenis replied: ‘The injury you’ve done me</p>
<p>requires a great wish to be set right,</p>
<p>that I might never suffer this again,</p>
<p>allow that I may be no more a woman,</p>
<p>and you will have fulfilled me utterly.’” <cite>(12.292–301)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

## Other Interesting Quotes

Ovid’s description of the heavens is humorous, as the gods themselves have household gods:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>When the nighttime sky is clear, there can be seen</p>
<p>a highway visible in heaven, named</p>
<p>the Milky Way, distinguished for its whiteness.</p>
<p>Gods take this path to the royal apartments</p>
<p>of Jove the Thunderer; on either side</p>
<p>are palaces with folding doors flung wide,</p>
<p>and filled with guests of their distinguished owners;</p>
<p>plebeian gods reside in other sections,</p>
<p>but here in this exclusive neighborhood,</p>
<p>the most renowned of heaven’s occupants</p>
<p>have <em>their</em> own household deities enshrined;</p>
<p>and if I were permitted to speak freely,</p>
<p>I would not hesitate to call this enclave</p>
<p>the Palatine of heaven’s ruling class. <cite>(1.229–42)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

Towards the end of Book I, Clymenes tells her son that:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>“It will not be a great task to discover</p>
<p>the place where your father [Apollo] keeps his household gods.” <cite>(1.1074–5)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

Procne carries of her son Itys, to murder him and feed him to her evil husband:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Now resolute, she carries Itys off,</p>
<p>just as a tiger on the Ganges’ banks</p>
<p>will drag a nursing fawn through the dense woods <cite>(6.922-4)</cite></p>
