## Outline

- 1.1–23 Introduction; Why it was the greatest war; Methodology
- 1.24–1.51 Cause: Epidamnus and Corcyra

## Purpose

Thucydides’ first stated purpose was to chronicle the great war.

<blockquote class="prose">
<p>Thucydides the Athenian wrote the history of the war fought between Athens and Sparta, beginning the account at the very outbreak of the war, in the belief that it was going to be a great war and more worth writing about than any of those which had taken place in the past. <cite>(1.1)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

He also wanted to help people understand the past, and (perhaps) to avoid repeating mistakes in the future:

<blockquote class="prose">
<p>And it may well be that my history will seem less easy to read because of the absence in it of a romantic element.  It will be enough for me, however, if these words of mine are judged useful by those who want to understand clearly the events which happened in the past and which (human nature being what it is) will, at some time or other and in much the same ways, be repeated in the future.  My work is not a piece of writing designed to meet the taste of an immediate public, but was done to last for ever. <cite>(1.22)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

He also wanted to establish his own excellence and, I believe, to spread his interpretation of the events.

## The Greatest War

Why did Thucydides’ believe the war he chronicled was the greatest war?

<blockquote class="prose">
<p>My belief was based on the fact that the two sides were at the very height of their power and preparedness, and I saw, too, that the rest of the Hellenic world was committed to one side or the other; even those who were not immediately engaged were deliberating on the courses which they were to take later. This [war] was the greatest disturbance in the history of the Hellenes, affecting also a large part of the non-Hellenic world, and indeed, I might almost say, the whole of mankind. <cite>(1.1)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

He then explains, using reason and observations from Greek legends, why earlier times were less sophisticated.  In these passages Thucydides reasons deeply about human motives.  For example, he deduces that earlier people did not have a “regular system of agriculture, since they lacked the protection of fortifications and at any moment an invader might appear and take their land from them.”  He deduces that earlier cities were placed inland to avoid raiders, but when sea-trade became more important, new cities were placed nearer to the coast.  He reasons the kings who accompanied Agamemnon did so because he was powerful, and not because of the oaths they took.  He trusts Homer’s narrative while being skeptical about the details (reminiscent of Herodotus’ argument that Helen was left in Egypt).

Thucydides’ recognizes how difficult it is to understand the past:

<blockquote class="prose">
<p>For though I have found it impossible, because of its remoteness in time, to acquire a really precise knowledge of the distance past or even of the history preceding our own period, yet, after looking back into it as far as I can, all the evidence leads me to conclude that these periods were not great periods either in warfare or in anything else. <cite>(1.1)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="prose">
<p>Mycenae certainly was a small place, and many of the towns of that period do not seem to us today to be particularly imposing; yet this is not good evidence for rejecting what the poets and what general tradition have to say about the size of the expedition.  Suppose, for example, that the city of Sparta were to become deserted and that only the temples and foundations of buildings remained, I think that future generations would, as time passed, find it very difficult to believe that they place had really been as powerful as it was represented to be. <cite>(1.10)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="prose">
<p>In investigating past history, and in forming the conclusions which I have formed, it must be admitted that one cannot rely on every detail which has come down to us by way of tradition.  People are inclined to accept all stories of ancient times in an uncritical way—even when these stories concerns their own native countries. <cite>(1.20)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="prose">
<p>However, I do not think that one will be far wrong in accepting the conclusions I have reached from the evidence which I have put forward.  It is better evidence than that of the poets, who exaggerate the importance of their themes, or of the prose chroniclers, who are less interested in telling the truth than in catching the attention of their public, whose authorities cannot be checked, and whose subject-matter, owing to the passage of time, is mostly lost in the unreliable streams of mythology.  We may claim instead to have used only the plainest evidence and to have reached conclusions which are reasonably accurate, considering that we have been dealing with ancient history.  As for this present war, even though people are apt to think that the war in which they are fighting is the greatest of all wars and, when it is over, to relapse again into their admiration of the past, nevertheless, if one looks at the facts themselves, one will see that this was the greatest war of all. <cite>(1.21)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

After commenting on his approach, Thucydides continues arguing that the Peloponnesian war was the greatest war by explaining why he thought it was greater than the war recounted by Herodotus:

<blockquote class="prose">
<p>The greatest war in the past was the Persian War; yet in this war the decision was reached quickly as a result of two navel battles and two battles on land. <cite>(1.22)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

## The Cause

<blockquote class="prose">
<p>What made war inevitable was the growth of Athenian power and the fear which this caused in Sparta. <cite>(1.23)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

The Greek poleis thought of themselves as independent political units.  During the war, there was pressure to join the Delian or Peloponnesian leagues.  In a limited sense, this was pressure for the Greeks to produce larger political structures.  This process is seen during the speech of the Corcyrians to the Athenians:

<blockquote class="prose">
<p>What has happened is that our policy in the past appears to have been against our own present interests, and at the same time makes it look inconsistent of us to be asking help from you.  It certainly looks inconsistent to be coming here to ask for help when in the past we have deliberately avoided all alliances; and it is because of this very policy that we are now left entirely along to fact a war with Corinth.  We used to think that our neutrality was a wise thing, since it prevented us being dragged into danger by other people’s policies; now we see it clearly as a lack of foresight and to a source of weakness. <cite>(1.32)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

Concerns about being overrun by larger political groups pressures smaller ones to merge.  Will this continue until there are two massive groups remaining?  Clearly other pressures push for smaller sizes.
