  A Detailed Commentary on White Fragility

  Notes on Robin Diangelo’s “White Fragility”

## Scope

The focus of the book is on why its hard to talk to white people about race.

It doesn’t discuss the evidence and extent of racism in America.

It assumes there is no “true biological race.” I.e., the external, visual characteristics that we “use to define race are unreliable indicators of genetic variation between any two people.”

## Summary



## Terms

<blockquote>
<p>The term <em>identity politics</em> refers to the focus on the barriers specific groups face in their struggle for equality.</p>
</blockquote>

The people at the tables of power, in government and business, are mostly white and male. Their decisions affect groups that are not in power. Even if exclusion was not intentional, it has occurred. Since we all have implicit bias, “inequity can occur through homogeneity; if I am not aware of the barriers you face, then I won’t see them, much less be motivated to remove them.”

Not naming groups servers the group that is in power.

<blockquote>
<p>White people in North America live in a society that is deeply separate by race, and white people are the beneficiaries of that separation and inequality.</p>
</blockquote>

Objectivity: It is possible for a person to be free from all bias.

Individualism: We are each unique and stand apart from others, even those within our social groups. Individualism claims that there are no intrinsic barriers to individual success and that failure is not a consequence of social structures but comes from individual character.

Most people define racist to be “mean people who intentionally dislike others because of their race.” DiAngelo defines racism differently: “When a racial group’s collective prejudice is backed by the power of legal authority and institutional control, it is transformed into racism, a far-reaching system that functions independently from the intentions or self-images of individual actors.”

Prejudice: pre-judgement about another person based on the social groups to which that person belongs.

Discrimination: action based on prejudice.

<blockquote>
<p>People of color may also hold prejudices and discriminate against white people, but they lack the social and institutional power that transforms their prejudice and discrimination into racism; the impact of their prejudice on whites is temporary and contextual.</p>
</blockquote>

## Criticism

### Unusual Definition of Objectivity

DiAngelo’s defines _objectivity_ to mean mean “believing it is possible to be free from all bias.” According to this definition, very few people would believe in objectivity. When I say I believe in objectivity, I mean that there is an underlying reality that is true, independent of observers, and that it is possible, using the scientific method, to find this underlying reality. Doing so is difficult, and it is not likely that any of us could be truly objective.  I think DiAngelo’s definition is confusing, because it makes it seem like she doesn’t believe there is an underlying true reality, or that there is somehow a different underlying reality for different groups.

Perhaps I am being pedantic here. I suspect that DiAngelo’s primary point is that most of us are more biased than we think we are, and that we should be cautious when reasoning about things we don’t have much experience with (like what the world would look like to people of another race). I think this is a wise policy, and one that we should hold in general—not just to racial matters.

### Non-standard Definition of Racism

As is the case with all words, there are temporal, geographic, and even racial variations in how words are used. Still, most words have a standard definition that allows people to communicate effectively. The words _racist_ and _racism_ are used in a certain standard way in America. You can see this in commonly used phrases like “we have a zero-tolerance policy for racism.”

DiAngelo’s definition of _racism_ is very similar to the standard definition of _structural racism_. Thus, besides the practical annoyance of using two words when one would do, one must ask why DiAngelo insists on redefining _racism_, and sowing confusion along the way? I think it is because she wants to emphasize that the standard use of _racism_ is not helpful; it causes white fragility. Thus, the insistence on changing the definition, instead of using _structural racism_ throughout her book, is a rhetorical device. I can see the reasoning behind such a definition, although the confusion it causes (especially when people see quotes and blurbs from the book, not having read it) seems to outweighs its rhetorical benefit.

### Racism and Morality

Another, more serious, problem with DiAngelo’s definition of racism is that it explicitly removes individual moral culpability. I.e., racism is no longer a moral question, as she states many times “I am not using [the standard] definition of racism, and I am not saying you are immoral.”

### DiAngelo’s Prejudice

DiAngelo’s assumptions about white-people are, by her own definition, prejudice, since she is making a pre-judgement about the reader based on them being white. Interestingly, immediately after her definition of prejudice, she says “prejudice consists of thoughts and feelings, including stereotypes, attitudes, and generalizations that are based on little or no experience and then projected onto everyone from that group.” Thus, it seems that she distinguishes her own ability, as a sociologist who is in the know, from the average person who is more ignorant.

### Approaches to Removing Systemic Racism

DiAngelo’s racism (i.e., systemic racism) occurs when:

1. group A has prejudice against group B
2. group A is in power (legal authority and institutional control)

Thus, what routes are available to reduce systemic racism?

We can reduce prejudice of group A towards B. This seems necessary, although difficult if not impossible to do completely.

A second approach is to remove group A from power, or at least to ensure that group B has enough power to level the playing field. Thus, it seems that very small groups must use the first approach—since they will never be in power, the best they can do is to try and reduce prejudice.

A third approach would be to remove the distinction between group A and group B. I.e., to be group-A/B-blind. This is also difficult to do. Perhaps this approach could be called the “melting pot” approach.

### Teaching White Children

The example, at the end of chapter two, of a white mom hushing her child who shouts “mommy, that man’s skin is black,” took me by surprise. Initially I defended the mom, thinking she just didn’t know how to handle an unexpected situation, and I suspect this would be how I would have acted in the same situation. After pondering the situation, I agreed with DiAngelo’s assessment: the mom’s response was due to her socialization into believing black skin is something to be ashamed of or embarrassed about.

How should the mom have acted? Perhaps she could say “yes sweetheart, some people have black skin” while simultaneously smiling at the man. I’m thankful to have had a chance to think about this issue.

### Color Blindness

DiAngelo defines _color blindness_ as an ideology that says “if we pretend not to notice race, then there can be no racism.” This ideology is absurd. Clearly we can tell when someone is black! And if we pretend race doesn’t exist, and don’t discuss race, we can’t address racism. We also can’t appreciate cultural differences if we pretend race doesn’t exist. Even worse, the ideology can be used to call someone who discusses race a racist!

DiAngelo’s derision of color-blindness, as she defines it, is appropriate, and I’ll defer to her experience that many people that believe this flawed ideology. But I’m surprised that she doesn’t discuss the more reasonable definition of _color-blindness_ that does not say we should ignore different cultures or races, but only that the law and businesses should treat people without considering their race. This type of color-blindness seems like a worthy long-term goal, and at face value, it seems like it is what MLK meant when he said he dreamed somedeay people would be judged by “the content of their character rather than the color of their skin.” (My understanding is that MLK moved away from color-blindness later.)

While the law can be color-blind, it is at best naive to think that most individuals can be. This bias will cut both ways, but will harm minorities much more than people in the majority group. Thus, voters  and managers from the majorty (white people in the US) will unavoidably discriminating against minorities.

To prevent this, it may be necessary to have laws which ensure businesses are not discriminating against certain groups. For example, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Such a law is not color-blind since it recognizes race. Thus, while color-blindness may be a worthy long-term goal, it is likely too idealistic in practice.

Furthermore, even if one agrees that color-blindness should be our long term goal, one may disagree that we can enact this now due to the history of discrimination and the need to address the harm that has been caused to black people and other groups. To address these issues, we may need even more explicitly color-aware laws.

It may be the case that DiAngelo agrees with the positions expressed here, and that she simply didn’t have space to discuss this moderate forms of color-blindness. If so, I think her omission was confusing and a turn-off for people who see the validity of color-blindness as a long-term goal.

### Aversive Racism

The second type of post-civil-rights racism that DiAngelo describes is _aversive racism_. This form of racism, unlike color-blind racism, is subconscious. She doesn’t provide a definition, but instead provides several examples. To supplement her short description, here are a few quotes from Samuel Gaetner’s book chapter, _Aversive Racism: Bias without Intention_ (2005):

<blockquote>
<p>Research in social psychology over the past 25 years, however, reveals that even racially well-intentioned people are often racist, and they are often racist without intention or awareness.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>We recognize that all racists are not aversive or subtle, that old-fashioned racism still exists, that there are individual differences in aversive racism, and that some Whites may not be racist at all. Nevertheless, we propose that aversive racism generally characterizes the racial attitudes of a large proportion of Whites who express nonprejudiced views and who intentionally try to avoid discriminating against Blacks and other minorities.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>In contrast to traditional approaches that emphasize the psychopathology of prejudice, the feelings and beliefs that underlie aversive racism are hypothesized to be rooted in normal, often adaptive, psychological processes… In addition, in contrast to the feelings of open hostility and clear dislike of Blacks, the feelings aversive racists experience are typically more diffuse, such as feelings of anxiety and uneasiness.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Generally, then, aversive racists may be identified by a constellation of characteristic responses to racial issues and interracial situations. First, aversive racists, in contrast to old-fashioned racists, endorse fair and just treatment of all groups. Second, despite their conscious good intentions, aversive racists unconsciously harbor feelings of uneasiness toward Blacks, and thus try to avoid interracial interaction. Third, when interracial interaction is unavoidable, aversive racists experience anxiety and discomfort, and consequently they try to disengage from the interaction as quickly as possible. Fourth, because part of the discomfort that aversive racists experience is due to a concern about acting inappropriately and appearing prejudiced, aversive racists strictly adhere to established rules and codes of behavior in interracial situations that they cannot avoid. Fifth and finally, their feelings will get expressed, but in subtle, unintentional, rationalizable ways that disadvantage minorities or unfairly benefit the majority group. Nevertheless, in terms of conscious intent, aversive racists intend not to discrimination against people of color—and they behave accordingly, when it is possible for them to monitor the appropriateness of their behavior.</p>
</blockquote>

From these passages I ask myself:

- Do I feel anxiety and uneasiness around black people?
- Do I avoid racial interaction?
- When in a racial interaction, do I try to leave as quickly as possible?
- Do you search for “established rules and codes of behavior” of interaction?
- How can my feelings of unease “unfairly benefit the majority group?”

I think they are worthwhile questions to ponder.

### Aversive Racism: Schools Example

Back in _White Fragility_, DiAngelo provides a list of ways “Whites enact racism while maintaining a positive self-image.” I really like her first example, and think it is important to ponder. It says “rationalizing racial segregation as unfortunate but necessary to access ‘good schools.’” In other words, we think the less segregated school is not as good as the nearly all white school, and since we want our child to have the best possible education, we maintain the segregation, and send our children to the white school. While this decision may not be consciously racist, it ultimately harms minorities,

Even so, I’m not sure how this is actually an example of _aversive racism_.

Since DiAngelo places quotes around “good schools,” I presume she is indicating that in this case the integrated school was just as good. If that is the case, then how is sending your white child to the all-white school harming the school or minorities at the school? Is it because, as a white person, you are presumed to be wealthier and to send more money to the school your child goes to, and by sending your child elsewhere you deprive the school of your money? But this seems to be contradicting the claim that the school is as good; presumably they have enough money and resources already. If anything, it would seem you are harming your own child by not providing them the experiences of interacting with a variety of different cultures.

Unfortunately, due to systemic racism, the more common case is that the school with minorities is actually not as good, according to test scores, resources, or something else. (If you say “these measures are racist and the school is actually as good,” then you have to explain how harm is being caused.) If the school is not as good, then sending your child to the all white school hurts minorities because your resources don’t go to the school. In this situation, someone has to ask themselves: maybe the school has more students per teacher but it’s worth it because my child will have relationships with diverse cultural views. Is it racist for parents to decide that low student-to-teach ratios are more important than diversity? I don’t think it categorically is so.

I may be reading too much into this example with the schools; I hope I am not misrepresenting DiAngelo’s views.

### Cultural Racism

I have re-read this section a few times, and I can’t tell what cultural racism is.

### Freedom of Movement

The example, of visiting “northern Idaho” and the being surrounded by white people, and possibly supremacists, was powerful. It helps reveal the myriad aspects of my whiteness that I take for granted.
