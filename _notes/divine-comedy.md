  Notes on Dante’s _Divine Comedy_

## Introduction

The *Divine Comedy* is Dante’s great epic poem.

## Poetic Summary



## Similes

The first simile in the _Comedy_ made me think of Odysseus’ landing on Phaecia, or how I feel after running a marathon:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p class="indent">At this my fear was somewhat quieted;</p>
<p>for through the night of sorrow I had spent,</p>
<p>the lake within my heart felt terror present.</p>
<p class="indent">And just as he who, with exhausted breath,</p>
<p>having escaped from sea to shore, turns back</p>
<p>to watch the dangerous waters he has quit,</p>
<p class="indent">so did my spirit, still a fugitive,</p>
<p>turn back to look intently at the pass</p>
<p>that never has let any man survive. <cite>(I.19–28)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

## The Pagan Gods

Dante combines Christianity with paganism in interesting ways.

Virgil comments about the gods’ state of bliss, when describing Fortune:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p class="indent">“She is the one so frequently maligned</p>
<p>even by those who should give praise to her—</p>
<p>they blame her wrongfully with words of scorn.</p>
<p class="indent">But she is blessed and does not hear these things;</p>
<p>for with the other primal beings, happy,</p>
<p>she turns her sphere and glories in her bliss.” <cite>(VI.91–96)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

## Submitting to Reason

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p class="indent">I learned that those who undergo this torment</p>
<p>are damned because they sinned within the flesh,</p>
<p>subjecting reason to the rule of lust. <cite>(V.37–39)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p class="indent">And he to me: “All these, to left and right</p>
<p>were squint-eyed of mind in the first life—</p>
<p>no spending that they did was done with measure.” <cite>(VII.40–42)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

## Questions

How does the gluttons punishment, being stuck in filthy rain, fit their crime?
