## Oedipus the King

Angered Tiresias implicates Oedipus:

<blockquote>
<p>So, you mock my blindness? Let me tell you this.</p>
<p>You with your precious eyes,</p>
<p>you’re blind to the corruption of your life,</p>
<p>to the house you live in, those you live with—</p>
<p>who <em>are</em> your parents? Do you know? All unknowing</p>
<p>you are the scourge of your own flesh and blood,</p>
<p>the dead below the earth and the living here above,</p>
<p>and the double lash of your mother and your father’s curse</p>
<p>will whip you from this land one day, their footfall</p>
<p>treading you down in terror, darkness shrouding</p>
<p>your eyes that can see the light!</p>
</blockquote>

The following quotations expresses two ideas central to the Greek world view. First, that the gods strip down the over-proud man, the man filled with hubris. Second, that we competition is healthy.

<blockquote>
<p>Destiny guide me always</p>
<p>Destiny guide me filled with reverence</p>
<p>pure in word and deed.</p>
<p>Great laws tower above us, reared on high</p>
<p>born for the brilliant vault of heaven—</p>
<p>Olympian Sky their only father,</p>
<p>nothing mortal, no man gave them birth,</p>
<p>their memory deathless, never lost in sleep:</p>
<p>within them lives a mighty god, the god does not</p>
<p>grow old. Pride breeds the tyrant</p>
<p>violent pride, gorging, crammed to bursting</p>
<p>with all that is overripe and rich with ruin—</p>
<p>clawing up to the heights, headlong pride</p>
<p>crashes down the abyss—sheer doom!</p>
<p>No footing helps, all foothold lost and gone.</p>
<p>But the healthy strife that makes the city strong—</p>
<p>I pray that god will never end that wrestling:</p>
<p>god, my champion, I will never let you go.</p>
</blockquote>

These two ideas are present in many of the ancient Greek works; Hesiod, near the opening of _Works and Days_, speaks of strife that causes men to compete with one another, doing people good; Herodotus’ stories highlight his belief that the gods tore down overproud men—he also explicitly discusses this idea; the _Iliad_ is filled with proud men striving with one other to “be the best.”

The Chorus, after Oedipus is revealed:

<blockquote>
<p>O the generations of men</p>
<p>the dying generations—adding the total</p>
<p>of all your lives I find they come to nothing…</p>
<p>does there exist, is there a man on earth</p>
<p>who seizes more joy than just a dream, a vision?</p>
<p>And the vision no sooner dawns than dies</p>
<p>blazing into oblivion.</p>
<p>You are my great example, you, your life</p>
<p>your destiny, Oedipus, man of misery—</p>
<p>I count no man blest.</p>
</blockquote>

Oedipus, chases after his wife and mother Jocasta:

<blockquote>
<p>His wife,</p>
<p>no wife, his mother, where can eh find the mother earth</p>
<p>that cropped two crops at once, himself and all his children?</p>
<p>He was raging—one of the dark powers pointing the way,</p>
<p>with a great shattering cry—someone, something leading him on—</p>
<p>he hurled at the twin doors and bending the bolts back</p>
<p>out of their sockets, crashed through the chamber.</p>
<p>And there we saw the woman hanging by the neck,</p>
<p>cradled high in a woven noose, spinning,</p>
<p>swinging back and forth. And when he saw her,</p>
<p>giving a low, wrenching sob that broke our hearts,</p>
<p>slipped the halter from her throat, he eased her down,</p>
<p>in a slow embrace he laid her down, poor thing…</p>
<p>then, what came next, what horror we beheld!</p>
<p>He rips off her brooches, the long gold pins</p>
<p>holding her robes—and lifting them high,</p>
<p>looking straight up into the points,</p>
<p>he digs them down the sockets of his eyes, crying, “You,</p>
<p>you’ll see no more the pain I suffered, all the pain I caused!</p>
<p>Too long you looked on the ones you never should have seen,</p>
<p>blind to the ones you longed to see, to know! Blind</p>
<p>from this hour on! Blind in the darkness—blind!”</p>
<p>His voice like a dirge, rising, over and over</p>
<p>raising the pins, raking them down his eyes.</p>
<p>And at each stroke blood spurts from the roots,</p>
<p>splashing his beard, a swirl of it, nerves and clots—</p>
<p>black hail of blood pulsing, gushing down.</p>
</blockquote>

The Chorus, at the end of the play:

<blockquote>
<p>People of Thebes, my countrymen, look on Oedipus.</p>
<p>He solved the famous riddle with his brilliance,</p>
<p>he rose to power, a man beyond all power.</p>
<p>Who could behold his greatness without envy?</p>
<p>Now what a black sea of terror has overwhelmed him.</p>
<p>Now as we keep our watch and wait the final day,</p>
<p>count no many happy till he dies, free of pain at last.</p>
</blockquote>

This metric for judging the happy life is in Herodotus’ fable of Solon meeting Croesus.

## Oedipus at Colonus

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Oh Theseus,</p>
<p>dear friend, only the gods can never age,</p>
<p>the gods can never die. All else in the world</p>
<p>almighty Time obliterates, crushes all</p>
<p>to nothing. The earth’s strength wastes away,</p>
<p>the strength of a man’s body wastes and dies—</p>
<p>faith dies, and bad faith comes to life,</p>
<p>and the same wind of friendship cannot blow forever,</p>
<p>holding steady and strong between two friends,</p>
<p>much less between two cities.</p>
<p>For some of us soon, for others later,</p>
<p>joy turns to hate and back again to love.</p>
<p>And even if all is summer sunshine now</p>
<p>between yourself and Thebes,</p>
<p>infinite Time, sweeping through its rounds</p>
<p>gives birth to infinte nights and days…</p>
<p>and a day will come when the treaties of an hour,</p>
<p>the pacts firmed by a handclasp will snap—</p>
<p>at the slightest word a spear will hurl them to the winds—</p>
<p>some far-off day when my dead body, slumbering, buried</p>
<p>cold in death, will drain their hot blood down,</p>
<p>if Zeus is still Zeus and Apollow the son of god</p>
<p>speaks clear and true. <cite>(685–707)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Here, stranger,</p>
<p>here in the land of horses are a glory</p>
<p>you have reached the noblest home on earth</p>
<p>Colonus glistening, brilliant in the sun—</p>
<p>where the nightingale sings on,</p>
<p>her dying music rising clear,</p>
<p>hovering always, never leavning,</p>
<p>down the shadows deepening green</p>
<p>she haunts the glades, the wine-dark ivy,</p>
<p>dense and dark the untrodden, sacred wood of god</p>
<p>rich with laurel and olives never touched by the sun</p>
<p>untouched by storms that blast from every quarter—</p>
<p>where the Reveler Dionysus strides the earth forever</p>
<p>where the wild nymphs are dancing round him</p>
<p>nymphs who nursed his life.</p>
<p>And here it blooms, fed by the dews of heaven</p>
<p>lovely, clustering, morning-fresh forever,</p>
<p>narcissus, crown of the Great Goddesss</p>
<p>Mother and Daughter dying</p>
<p>into life from the dawn of time,</p>
<p>and the gold crocus bursts like break of day</p>
<p>and the springs will never sleep, will never fail,</p>
<p>the fountainhead of Cephisus flowing nomad</p>
<p>quickening life forever, fresh each day—</p>
<p>life rising up with the river’s pure tide</p>
<p>flowing over the plains, the swelling breats of earth—</p>
<p>nor can the dancing Muses bear to leave this land</p>
<p>or the Goddess Aphrodite, the charioteer</p>
<p>with the golden reins of love. <cite>(761–89)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Suffer us to live here … even in these straights</p>
<p>our life is not as pitiful as you’d think,</p>
<p>so long as we find joy in every hour. <cite>(909–11)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

Oedipus declaring his innocence to Creon, in front of Theseus and the Athenians:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Unctuous, shameless—where do you think your insults</p>
<p>do more damage, my old age or yours? Bloodshed</p>
<p>incest, misery, all your mouth lets fly at me,</p>
<p>I have suffered it all, and all against my will!</p>
<p>Such was the pleasure of the gods, raging,</p>
<p>perhaps, against our race from ages past.</p>
<p>But as for me alone—</p>
<p>say my unwilling crimes against myself</p>
<p>and against my own were payment from the gods</p>
<p>for something criminal deep inside me…no, look hard,</p>
<p>you’ll find no guilt to accuse me of—I am innocent!</p>
<p>⋯</p>
<p>And my mother…</p>
<p>wretched man, have you no shame? Your own sister!</p>
<p>Her marriage—forcing me to talk of that marriage!</p>
<p>Oh I’ll tell it all, I won’t be silent, not now,</p>
<p>you and your blasphemous mouth have gone so far.</p>
<p>She was my mother, yes, she bore me—</p>
<p>oh the horror—I knew nothing, she knew nothing!—</p>
<p>and once she’d born me then she bore me children,</p>
<p>her disgrace. But at least I know one thing:</p>
<p>you slander her and me of your own free will,</p>
<p>but I made her my bride against my will,</p>
<p>I repeat this to the world againnst my will. No,</p>
<p>I’ll not be branded guilty, not in that marriage,</p>
<p>not in the murder of my father, all those crimes</p>
<p>you heap on me relentlessly, harrowing my heart. <cite>(1095–1131)</cite></p>
