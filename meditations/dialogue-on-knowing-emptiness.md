Eurus:: Happy New Year!

Dijon:: Happy New Year! I hope our discussion leads to new ideas or new confidence in old ones.

Eurus:: Suppose that you were dreaming, and in the dream, you performed the double slit experiment, and the results coincided with our current understanding of quantum mechanics. Does the wave function from the dream _fundamentally exists_ in your sense of the term? If not, why? If so, do you believe that there is a meaningful distinction between dream quantum mechanics and waking-life quantum mechanics, and could this distinction ever be known?

Dijon:: These are a thought-provoking questions. I do think the wave function in the dream fundamentally exists.

If the dream is like my dreams, then the world of the dream operates inconsistently and bizarrely. Furthermore, everything in the dream originates from my own mind; the closest anything is to being new or independent of my mind would be simple super-positions of existing memories. In such a dream, the double slit experiment, and the knowledge of the wave function that I would infer from it, are reflections of the waking-life quantum mechanics. Even in waking life we don't ever know the existence of the wave function directly; we only know of it through our memories of sense-data produced from reading and experiments. The dream of the double slit experiment would be like a memory of the waking-life double slit experiment, and therefore the dream wave-function is a reflection of the real-life wave function which does fundamentally exist.

I don't think this is the sort of dream you had in mind when you asked the question. So instead consider a dream that is similar to reality. The world of the dream operates consistently. When I perform the double slit experiment, I may see different results than we see in reality, however, if I would always get consistent results. Perhaps there are be fellow scientists in the dream, experimenting and writing papers. The world of the dream would also allow for events that are more than simple super-positions of my memories. These _surprises_ would demonstrate to myself, in the dream, that the world of the dream is independent of my dream mind. In short, the dream would be such that I couldn't distinguish it from reality. Thus, it would not be possible to distinguish dream quantum mechanics from waking-life quantum mechanics.

I think the second dream's wave function fundamentally exists, but for different reasons than I think the first one's does. The fact that the wave function was produced by my mind has now become an inaccessible metaphysical implementation detail; I would have no way of knowing about it, unless they were somehow revealed to me, say when I woke up.

If "my" mind were capable of generating an entire consistent and independent dream world, then it seems like it may as well not be called "my" mind. It would be more like a computer simulation or something else. Some people think our reality is like this---we are in a computer simulation or are in the "mind of God". Either could be true. Without revelation of some sort, there is no way for us to know for certain either way.

Eurus:: Your answer highlights why your definition of _fundamentally exist_ is unsatisfactory. By defining it to always be meaningful to the scientist you've made it apply to dream wave functions. Realizing śūnyatā, or emptiness, is like waking up from such a dream.

Dijon:: Perhaps, but I don't think the second type of dream is possible in our material world; the brain couldn't contain enough information to produce an entire universe. Thus, it feels unsatisfactory in a thought experiment, but it wouldn't occur in reality.

I defined the term in this way since I don't see how we could possibly know anythin fact about reality that doesn't produce observations. You're saying our mind can _directly learn_ about the metaphysical foundations of the existence, for example, that nothing has svabhāva. If this is true, the mind is indeed primary.
