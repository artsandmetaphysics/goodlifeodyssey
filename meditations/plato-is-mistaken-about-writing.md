Dijon:: Excuse me gentlemen. I was on my way to Athens, and I saw this beautiful stream through the trees near the path and decided to walk along its banks. I walked near the gurgling water in the heat for an hour. Then, as I approached this tall tree, the faint echoes of your voices rose above the cicadas. You were so busy with your intercourse that you didn't hear me. And so I've been standing here listening for some time. I didn't want to interrupt, yet I couldn't pull myself away. Then, just now, you said something I couldn't bear.

Socrates:: What is it that was so difficult for you to bear that you had to interrupt our dialogue with this speech of your own?

Dijon:: You besmirched the written word, saying it can do no more than remind us of what we already know. Most of what I've learned has been taught to me from written words. If you were attacked unfairly, wouldn't it be just for your pupils come to your aid? Likewise I must come to the aid of my greatest teacher, the written word.

Socrates:: I shall try to explain. Writing shares a strange feature with painting. Paintings stand there as if they are alive, but if anyone asks them anything, they remain most solemnly silent. The same is true of written words. You'd think they were speaking as if they had some understanding, but if you question anything that has been said because you want to learn more, it continues to signify just that very same thing forever. And when it is faulted and attacked unfairly, it always needs its father's support; alone, it can neither defend itself nor come to its own support.

Therefore, if you read and understand written words, then you already had the knowledge needed to understand it. If you read and don't understand written words, you will have nobody to question. Therefore, written words can only remind us of what we already know.

Phaedrus:: Well said. You are absolutely right about this.

Socrates:: We need a more capable discourse, one that is written down, with knowledge, in the soul of the listener. We need a discourse that can defend itself.

Phaedrus:: You mean the living, breathing discourse of the man who knows, of which the written one can be fairly called an image.

Socrates:: That's absolutely right. The dialectician chooses a proper soul and plants and sows within it discourse accompanied by knowledge---discourse capable of helping itself as well as the man who planted it, which is not barren but produces a seed from which more discourse grows in the character of others. Such discourse makes the seed forever immortal and renders the man who has it as happy as any human can be.

Dijon:: Well, this is what I've read. Among the ancient scribes of Egypt, there is one who wrote the following:

"As for those wise writers from the time after the gods, they who foretold what was to come, their names have become everlasting, even though they have departed this life and all their relatives are forgotten.

"They gave themselves a book as their lector-priest, a writing-board as their dutiful son. Teachings are their mausoleum, the reed-pen their child, the burnishing-stone their wife. Both great and small are given them as their children, for the writing is chief.

"Be a writer, take it to heart, so that _your_ name will fare likewise. A book is more effective than a carved tombstone or a permanent sepulcher. They serve as chapels and mausoleum in the mind of him who proclaims their names. A name on people's lips will surely be effective in the afterlife!

"Is there one here like Hordedef? Is there another like Imhotep? None of our kin is like Neferti or Khety, their leader. May I remind you about Ptahemdjehuty and Khakheperraseneb! Is there another like Ptahhotep, or the equal of Kairsu?

"Those wise men who foretold what was to come: what they said came into being; it is found as a maxim, written in their books Other's offspring will be their heirs, as if they were their own children. They hid their magic from the world, but it is read in their teachings. They are gone, their names forgotten; but writings cause them to be remembered."

Phaedrus:: Do you really believe an ancient scribe wrote this?

Dijon:: I do believe it, for scholars from my land dug up this scroll and many like it and learned how to read them. And so, having relayed this ancient account, I'd like to question your older companion: Why would the scribe praise Hordedef, Imhotep, Neferti, Khety, Ptahemdjehuty, Khakheperraseneb, Ptahhotep, and Kairsu if their writings merely reminded him of what he already knew?

Socrates:: The teachings of these ancient wise men and prophets were planted in the souls of their contemporaries, and they grew like reeds, slowly at first, until they covered the banks of the Nile. As the great river flooded and receded, and as pharaohs conquered and were conquered, these reeds swayed back and forth in the muddy waters, one constant among a great deal of change. And so, the meaning of these sayings were planted in the soul of this scribe by his mother, father, and grandmother long before he had heard the name Hordedef or Ptahhotep. The attribution to these scholars was made afterwards. In fact, I don't doubt that some of the sayings were planted by other forgotten souls, who by ascribing their wisdom to these great names were using them as a sort of fertilizer to ensure their reeds wouldn't die out.

TODO: talk about how difficult it would be for a reed to take hold in Thrace, a place with a different culture (and, he thinks, very ignorant). Thus, the wise men of one place may not seem so wise in another. At least not until the reeds have spread around the globe.

Dijon:: I see that I have not convinced you. Let us then imagine that this scribe is struck deaf and dumb by Ammon for attributing immortality to the written word. He dies, and in the afterlife he meets the sage Ptahhotep. He writes a note on a piece of papyrus:

"Vizier Ptahhotep, I prostrate myself before you, my superior. I have read your many teachings and taught them to my sons. As you know, they are on the lips of all lovers of wisdom in Egypt. Most of your sayings I could understand on my own, however, I have had a question about one of them. I can not speak or hear, but if you would deem to write responses on this papyrus, we can converse."

The vizier, Ptahhotep is impatient, but he he writes the following: "I will answer your question."

Our deaf and dumb scribe bows very low, and without standing again he writes:

"Your thirty-first maxim says:

> Do not have sex with a boy
> when you know that what is condemned will satisfy his desire.
> There is no cooling his lust.
> Let him not spend the night doing what is condemned:
> he will cool down only after he has mastered his desire.

"This practice, of older men having sex with boys, is universally rejected in my time. Yet you speak against it as if it was common. This leads me to ask: does right and wrong change?"

He hands the papyrus to Ptahhotep, who fills the papyrus with his reply, and places it on the ground in front of our scribe, whose head is still bowed. Our scribe begins reading. He reads of a middle path, explained by the gods of the underworld, that demonstrates how right and wrong changes in some ways but is fixed in other ways by the structure of the universe. Our scribe is awed and frenzied by the answer that he doesn't notice as Ptahhotep walks away.

Our scribe reads the dialogue over and over again, studying its beautiful parts. But then he remembers Ammon's chastisement, and having already memorized its contents, he throws the papyrus back into the Styx, returning the reeds to where he'd harvested them.

Centuries later, a living musician crosses the Styx and asks Anubis to return his young wife. The musician plays a song that is so beautiful, Anubis relents, and is so overwhelming that our scribe can hear for a brief time.

He is overwhelmed with joy, and so he seeks out an audience with the musician's young wife, hoping to meet her before she is allowed to return to the mortal realm. He finds her, in fact before she has heard of her release. He gives her two papyri. The first one says: "Your husband, Orpheus, has come for you and convinced Annubis to allow you to return to Greece. Take this second papyrus with you. On it is a dialogue with secret wisdom from the underworld. It explains how right and wrong can be known from the fixed structure of the universe, and it will be a great boon to mankind." She accepts the gift, not knowing it is her doom. For, Annubis does not want this dialogue to make known its secrets, and so he wills her to look back.

It is clear that our scribe never repented from his love of writing, and it saddens me to think of the punishment he must bear for his transgression.

I've had the very same questions that our scribe asked of Ptahhotep. Do you think, if I were to read the dialogue on this papyrus, that it would merely be reminding me of what I already know?

TODO: Say the scribe asks "precisely" the question I would have asked; perhaps because I was the scribe in a past life.

Socrates:: I would like to ask whether your scholars dug up a scroll with this story, but you are the one asking me questions, and so I'll keep the goal of our conversation in mind.

If Eurydice had smuggled this dialogue into Thrace and if you could read and understood its profound secrets, then your soul must have known them already. Don't men yearn for an absolute moral standard? Maybe ours souls, in past lives, have already been given the Ptahhotep's secrets. It seems, then, the dialogue is only be reminding you of secret knowledge deep in your soul.

Dijon:: Perhaps your response is right in some respects, but it prompts a new question: can dialectic teach you something that is not known, deep in your soul?

Socrates:: I don't believe it can.

Dijon:: If so, how is a written dialogue worse than an oral one?

Socrates:: As I said, it is better because you can ask questions, and I can answer.

Dijon:: But, I had the same question as our scribe. Thus, Ptahotep's answer may as well have been spoken to me.

Socrates:: You may have more than one question though.

Dijon:: It's true, but if the written word can answer even one question, then its clear it can do more than remind us of what we already know.

. Therefore, can only remind us of what we know, then why is dialectic better than the written word?

Socrates::

TODO: talk about the wide availability of books to answer many questions

TODO: talk about how dialectic forces people to face opinions they don't want to face, but that this is only true if you are conversing with the right people---people with different opinions and a willingness to disagree. If you converse with people that will just agree with you, then dialectic is no better than the written word. Allusions to twitter/present day and rhetoric.

TODO: argument:

1. if you have dialectical discussion, does the person learn? yes
2. what if you wrote down this discourse, so someone could read it---could they learn, yes but they'd have other questions
3. you could write other dialogues
4. discuss the desired to learn; need to give the author the benefit of the doubt

Dijon:: Forgive me for saying so, as you seem to be a wise man, pursuing the truth wholeheartedly and aware of how to speak convincingly, but you are mistaken.

It is true that the written word can not defend itself. 

TODO: make comparison between Socrates and the Amon myth; Socrates "invented" the dialectic, and so he loves it more than he should

TODO: talk about the value of writing, and how writing can create new thoughts out of nothing

Dijon:: Does all spoken conversation lead us to the truth?

Socrates:: Clearly no.

Dijon:: In what ways does conversation fail to lead us to the truth?

Socrates:: When the two parties agree with one another, they may not know which questions to ask themselves to reveal their ignorance or incorrect views. TODO: replace with example from sports

Or, one person may know the truth but does want to correct the other person. TODO: a young man complaining about his father to his older lover, the lover may not want to correct the younger man for the fear of pushing the younger man away.

Dijon:: Thus, it doesn't see there is anything about conversation that is unique. Rather, it is a desire to seek the truth that matters. This desire can be found in two people conversing, as well as in a single person reading books in a library. Which approach is more likely to lead someone to the truth may depend more on how easy it is to find a smart person to talk or the appropriate book to read, rather than anything else. Where I come from, it is often easier to find the right book to read then the right person to talk to.

How can we make people want to seek the truth?

Socrates:: It is quite a difficult thing.

TODO: Add discussion about how to help people pursue the truth

1. Socrates pursued Phaedrus. Don't dismiss their views (e.g., Lysias) directly.

2. Show an interest in the other person.

3. Reference the Gorgias conversation
