Dijon:: Excuse me gentlemen. I was on my way to Athens, and I saw this beautiful stream through the trees near the path and decided to walk along its banks. I walked near the gurgling water in the heat for an hour. Then, as I approached this tall tree, the faint echoes of your voices rose above the cicadas. You were so busy with your intercourse that you didn't hear me. And so I've been standing here listening for some time. I didn't want to interrupt, yet I couldn't pull myself away. Then, just now, you said something I couldn't bear.

Socrates:: What is it that was so difficult for you to bear that you had to interrupt our dialogue with this speech of your own?

Dijon:: You besmirched the written word, saying it can do no more than remind us of what we already know. Most of what I've learned has been taught to me from written words. If you were attacked unfairly, wouldn't it be just for your pupils come to your aid? Likewise I must come to the aid of my greatest teacher, the written word.

Socrates:: I shall try to explain. Writing shares a strange feature with painting. Paintings stand there as if they are alive, but if anyone asks them anything, they remain most solemnly silent. The same is true of written words. You'd think they were speaking as if they had some understanding, but if you question anything that has been said because you want to learn more, it continues to signify just that very same thing forever. And when it is faulted and attacked unfairly, it always needs its father's support; alone, it can neither defend itself nor come to its own support.

Phaedrus:: Well said. You are absolutely right about this.

Socrates:: We need a more capable discourse, one that is written down, with knowledge, in the soul of the listener. We need a discourse that can defend itself.

Phaedrus:: You mean the living, breathing discourse of the man who knows, of which the written one can be fairly called an image.

Socrates:: That's absolutely right. The dialectician chooses a proper soul and plants and sows within it discourse accompanied by knowledge---discourse capable of helping itself as well as the man who planted it, which is not barren but produces a seed from which more discourse grows in the character of others. Such discourse makes the seed forever immortal and renders the man who has it as happy as any human can be.

Dijon:: Well, this is what I've read. Among the ancient scribes of Egypt, there is one who wrote of writing:

"As for those wise writers from the time after the gods, they who fortold what was to come, their names have become everlasting, even though they have departed this life and all their relatives are forgotten.

"They gave themselves a book as their lector-priest, a writing-board as their dutiful son. Teachings are their mausolea, the reed-pen their child, the burnishing-stone their wife. Both great and small are given them as their children, for the writing is chief.

"Be a writer, take it to heart, so that _your_ name will fare likewise. A book is more effective than a carved tombstone or a permanent sepulchre. They serve as chapels and mausolea in the mind of him who proclaims their names. A name on people's lips will surely be effective in the afterlife!

"Is there one here like Hordedef? Is there another like Imhotep? None of our kin is like Neferti or Khety, their leader. May I remind you about Ptahemdjehuty and Khakheperraseneb! Is there another like Ptahhotep, or the equal of Kairsu?

"Those wise men who foretold what was to come: what they said came into being; it is found as a maxim, written in their books Other's offspring will be their heirs, as if they were their own children. They hid their magic from the world, but it is read in their teachings. They are gone, their names forgotten; but writings cause them to be remembered."

Phaedrus:: Do you really believe an ancient scribe wrote this?

Dijon:: I do believe it, for scholars from my land dug up this scroll and many like it and learned how to read hieroglyphics. And so, having relayed this ancient account, I'd like to question your older companion: Why would the scribe praise Hordedef, Imhotep, Neferti, Khety, Ptahemdjehuty, Khakheperraseneb, Ptahhotep, and Kairsu if their writings merely reminded him of what he already knew?

Socrates:: The teachings of these ancient wiesmen and prophets were planted in the souls of their contemporaries, and they grew like reeds, slowly at first, until they covered the banks of the Nile. As the great river flooded and receded, and as pharaohs conquered and were conquered, these reeds swayed back and forth in the muddy waters. And so, the meaning of these sayings were already planted in the soul of this scribe before he had even hear the name Hordedef or Ptahhotep. In fact, I don't doubt that some of the sayings were planted by other souls who are now as forgotten as the relatives of the ancient writers they are ascribed to.

Dijon:: I see that I have not convinced you. Let us then imagine that this scribe is struck deaf and dumb by Ammon for attributing immortality to the written word. He dies and in the afterlife he meets the sage Ptahhotep. He writes the following on a piece of papyrus:

"Vizier Ptahhotep, I bow to you, my superior, asking for your time. I have read your teachings and have repeated them to my sons. They are on the lips of everyone who loves wisdom in Egypt. Most of your sayings were easy for me to understand on my own, however, I have had questions about a few of them. I can not speak or hear, but if you would deem to write on this papyrus we can converse in this way."

The vizier, Ptahhotep is happy to oblige our scribe, and so he writes the following: "I will do my best to answer your questions. What sayings do you have questions about?"

Our deaf and dumb scribe bows very low, and without standing up again he writes his question:

"Your thirty-first maxim says:

> Do not have sex with a boy
> when you know that what is condemned will satisfy his desire.
> There is no cooling his lust.
> Let him not spend the night doing what is condemned:
> he will cool down only after he has mastered his desire.

"This practice, of older men having sex with boys, is universally rejected by people in my time. Yet you include a maxim speaking against it, as if it was common at the time you wrote it. This leads me to ask: is right and wrong what people say it is?"

He hands the papyrus to Ptahhotep, who laughs. He then writes a long reply, nearly filling the papyrus with his response. In it he explains a middle path, how right and wrong depends on consensus but also on the fixed structure of the universe, and many other wise things that were revealed to him by the gods in the underworld. Our scribe begins reading and is so awed by the wise answer to his question that he doesn't notice as Ptahhotep walks out of sight.

Our scribe keeps this papyrus for many days, reading it over and over again, studying its beautiful parts. But then he remembers Ammon's chastiesment, and so he memorizes his dialogue with Ptahotep and throws the papyrus into the Styx, where he had harvested the reeds in the first place.

Many centuries later the underworld is put into an uproar when a living musician crosses the Styx and asks Anubis to return his young wife. The musician plays a song that is so beautiful, Anubis relents, and is so overwhelming that our scribe can hear for a brief time.

He is overwhelmed with joy, and so he seeks out an audience with the muscian's youn wife, hoping to meet her before she is allowed to return to the mortal realm. He finds her, in fact before she has heard of her release. He gives her two papyrii. The first one says: "Your husband, Orpheus, has come for you and convinced Annubis to allow you to return to Greece. Take this second papyrus with you. On it is a dialogue with secret wisdom from the underworld. It explains how right and wrong can be known from the fixed structure of the universe, and it will be a great boon to mankind." She accepts the gift.

It is clear that our scribe never repented from his love of writing, and it saddens me to think of the punishment he must bear for his transgression.



Could a man who's been struck deaf for impiety 

TODO: argument:

1. if you have dialectical discussion, does the person learn? yes
2. what if you wrote down this discourse, so someone could read it---could they learn, yes but they'd have other questions
3. you could write other dialogues
4. discuss the desired to learn; need to give the author the benefit of the doubt

Dijon:: Forgive me for saying so, as you seem to be a wise man, pursuing the truth wholeheartedly and aware of how to speak convincingly, but you are mistaken.

It is true that the written word can not defend itself. 

TODO: make comparison between Socrates and the Amon myth; Socrates "invented" the dialectic, and so he loves it more than he should

TODO: talk about the value of writing, and how writing can create new thoughts out of nothing
