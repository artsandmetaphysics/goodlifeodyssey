Socrates, in the _Republic_, assumes that language is as precise as math. For example, in book four, he says if his imaginary city is good then it is "wise, courageous, moderate, and just." This is a reasonable definition of _good_, although I hesitate to say it's complete. Socrates' does not hesitate, and he uses this definition to launch a curious analysis:

> Therefore, just as with any other four things, if we were seeking any one of them in something or other and recognized the other three first, this would also suffice for the recognition of the thing looked for. For plainly it couldn't be anything but what's left over. With these things too, since they happen to be four, mustn't we look for them in the same way?

It's as if Socrates defined _good_ using a summation:

> good = wise + courageous + moderate + just

Therefore, we can define _just_ using a subtraction:

> just = good - wise - courageous - moderate

This reasoning only works if the definition is complete. If it isn't complete, you'll have at least one extra term:

> good = wise + courageous + moderate + just + X

If we move the known terms to the right side of the equation, we'd still have two unknown terms on the left:

> just + X = good - wise - courageous - moderate

Thus, you couldn't separate _just_ from the unknown term.

This mathematical definition of _just_, to be a valid, would also require a precisely knowledge of _good_, _wise_, _courageous_, and _moderate_.

Neither assumption seems correct to me; the definition seems incomplete and we don't know these terms with the necessary precision.

I don't think we can define words precisely. We learn most words by example; we see how other people use them and we follow. Furthermore, terms are models of a complex reality. Terms are incomplete models. We say both bananas and lemons are _yellow_, despite their subtle differences. Thus _yellow_ is incomplete, but most of the time we don't care. If we're repainting our home, we'll use a precise color, say _Benjamin Moore lemon yellow five_. Terms are also approximate models. Are grapefruits yellow, orange, or pink? My wife says salmon, I say yellow.

I think _good_, _just_, _wise_, _courageous_, and _moderate_ are approximate and incomplete models of reality too. We've learned what they mean through examples, and to treat them as if they were as precise as a mathematical circle is misguided.
