Socrates, in the _Republic_, treats words as if they can be mathematically analyzed. For example, in book four, he hopes his imaginary city is "perfectly good". To be good, he continues, is to be "wise, courageous, moderate, and just." These four terms may give a reasonable definition of _good_, although I hesitate to say it's complete. Socrates' does not hesitate:

> Therefore, just as with any other four things, if we were seeking any one of them in something or other and recognized the other three first, this would also suffice for the recognition of the thing looked for. For plainly it couldn't be anything but what's left over. With these things too, since they happen to be four, mustn't we look for them in the same way?

It's as if Socrates defined _good_ using a summation:

> good = wise + courageous + moderate + just

Therefore, we can define _just_ using a subtraction:

> just = good - wise - courageous - moderate

This is curious reasoning, and it reveals how Plato viewed language.

This reasoning only works if the list is complete. If it isn't complete, you'll have at least one extra term:

> good = wise + courageous + moderate + just + X

If we move the known terms to the right side of the equation, we'd still have two unknown terms on the left:

> just + X = good - wise - courageous - moderate

Thus, you couldn't separate _just_ from the unknown term.

This mathematical definition of _just_, to be a valid, also requires we precisely know the meaning of _good_, _wise_, _courageous_, and _moderate_.

Neither assumption seems correct to me. The list of terms doesn't seem complete nor do we have a complete knowledge of the subterms.

I don't think we can define words precisely. We learn most words by example; we see how other people use them and we follow. Furthermore, words are models for a complex underlying reality. This model is incomplete---we use _yellow_ for bananas and lemons, as well as approximate---is a grapefruit yellow or orange, some side either way. And all our words are like this---specialists develop lingo since they need more precision than our everyday words, or models, provide us. I think _good_, _just_, _wise_, _courageous_, and _moderate_ are models too. We've learned what they mean through examples, and to treat them as if they were as precise as a mathematical circle is misguided.
