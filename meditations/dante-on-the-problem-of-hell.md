If God is supremely good then why does hell exist? I can accept that unrepentant sinners shouldn't be in heaven, but why must they be eternally punished? Wouldn't a supremely good God make unrepentant sinners, upon death, cease to exist instead of making them exist in pain indefinitely?

Here's a solution to the problem of hell: Maybe God cares more about preserving our autonomy than minimizing some utilitarian metric. Furthermore, maybe C.S. Lewis was right and all of hell's citizens choose to be there. I'd also imagine that they could also choose to cease existing if they'd like, since why would an all powerful supremely good God force people to continue existing in hell against their will?

I hope C.S Lewis is right! First, because it would mean there's a heaven, that I could be in the presence of an all-loving God, that I could have enough time to grow many relationships as deep as the one I have with my wife, that I'd continue my conscious joyful existence. Second, because I wouldn't choose to go to hell. I'm not Christian because I don't believe it. I've considered the evidence---the structure of the physical universe, biological evolution, the bible's inconsistencies, and the history of religions---and came away not believing it. I may be wrong though. If I got to heaven and found out that I was mistaken, I'd be ecstatic and I'd kindly request to be let in. Thus, I hope that C.S. Lewis is right that everyone in hell chooses to be there.

Did Dante think that all of hell's denizens choose to be there? I've asked myself this during the past few months as I've studied his masterpiece. It seems unlikely to me; some sinners are punished with apparently self-inflicted wounds, but many are not. Consider the sowers of scandal in the ninth ditch of the eight circle, repeatedly healing and being cut open by a demon with a sword. This isn't a self-inflicted would. Rather, it's divine justice for sins.

Why does this matter? C.S. Lewis idea that sinners all choose to go to hell solves a tough theological problem. Maybe he's right, but it does contradict the medieval conception of hell as a place of divine retribution and torment.
