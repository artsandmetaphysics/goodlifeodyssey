If God is supremely good then why does hell exist? I can accept that unrepentant sinners shouldn't be in heaven, but why must they be eternally punished? Wouldn't a supremely good God make unrepentant sinners, upon death, cease to exist instead of making them exist in pain indefinitely?

Here's a solution to the problem of hell: Maybe God cares more about preserving our autonomy than minimizing some utilitarian metric. Furthermore, maybe C.S. Lewis was right and all of hell's citizens _choose_ to be there. I also propose that this is a choice between heaven, hell, and non-existence, since why would an all powerful, supremely good God force people to continue existing in hell against their will?

I hope C.S Lewis's solution is true! First, because it would mean there's a heaven, that I could be in the presence of an all-loving God forever. It would mean people all relationships could be as deep as the relationship between a couple who's been married sixty years. It would mean I could continue enjoying existence. If everyone goes to hell because they choose too, then I wouldn't choose to go to hell. I want to believe that Christianity is true, but I don't believe it because the evidence---the structure of the physical universe, biological evolution, the bible's inconsistencies, and the history of religions---doesn't support it. Or so I believe. I have a finite, limited mind and very well could be wrong. If I got to heaven and found out that I was wrong, I'd be ecstatic. Thus, I hope that C.S. Lewis is right that everyone in hell chooses to be there, since if so it implies that God doesn't arbitrarily require people to have faith in something that appears to be false.

Did Dante think that all of hell's denizens choose to be there? I've asked myself this during the past few months as I've studied his masterpiece. It seems unlikely; some punishments appear to be with self-inflicted, but many are not. Consider the sowers of scandal in the ninth ditch of the eight circle, repeatedly healing and being cut open by a demon with a sword. This isn't a hell that someone would choose over non-existence. Rather, Dante's hell is one filled with retributive justice---as it's gate states: "justice urged on my high artificer."

C.S. Lewis idea that sinners all choose to go to hell solves a tough theological problem. Maybe he's right, but it's noteworthy that his conception contradicts the medieval conception of hell as a place of divine retribution and torment.
