If God is supremely good then why does hell exist? I can accept that unrepentant sinners shouldn't be in heaven, but why must they be eternally punished? Wouldn't a supremely good God make unrepentant sinners, upon death, cease to exist instead of being eternally tormented---even if that torment is self-inflicted? And even if guilt demands justice, what sin found in a finite life could justly lead to infinite pain?

Here's an answer to these questions---a solution to the problem of hell: All of hell's citizens _choose_ to be there. At any point, they could choose to go to heaven or to stop existing, but they want to exist in hell. The utilitarian might object: "Even though the sinners continually choose to exist in hell, God knows they'd be better off not existing, so he should wipe them from existence." Perhaps, but maybe God cares more about preserving our autonomy than minimizing some utilitarian metric?

Some theologians suggest that we only get to choose between heaven or hell, but this begs the original question, since why would an all-powerful, supremely good God force people to continue existing in hell against their will?

Others have suggested that we choose heaven or hell when we're on earth, even if once in hell we might regret our choice. This also begs the question, since once again, why would an supremely good God keep people in eternal torment? We solved the problem by saying it was their _choice_, but for this to work they must _continually_ choose to stay in hell.

I hope it's true that everyone gets to choose between heaven, hell, and non-existence.

If everyone goes to hell because they choose too, then I wouldn't choose to go to hell. I _want_ to believe that Christianity is true, but I don't believe it because the evidence---the structure of the physical universe, biological evolution, the bible's inconsistencies, and the history of religions---doesn't support it. Or so I believe. I have a finite, limited mind and very well could be wrong. If I die and find out I'm wrong, I'd be ecstatic.

It would mean that I could be in the presence of an all-loving God forever. It would mean all relationships could be as deep as the relationship between a couple who's been married sixty years. It would mean I could continue enjoying existence.  Finally, it would mean God doesn't arbitrarily require people to have faith in something that appears to be false to get into heaven.

Did Dante think that all of hell's denizens choose to be there? I've asked myself this during the past few months as I've studied his masterpiece. It seems unlikely; some punishments appear to be with self-inflicted, but many are not. Consider the sowers of scandal in the ninth ditch of the eight circle, repeatedly healing and being cut open by a demon with a sword:

>   No barrel, even though it's lost a hoop
> or end-piece, ever gaps as one whom I
> saw ripped right from his chin to where we fart:
>   how bowels hung between his legs, one saw
> his vitals and the miserable sack
> that makes of what we swallow excrement.

This sinner looks up at Dante and asks why he is dawdling here. Virgil interjects and says "Death has not reached him yet, nor is it guilt that summons him to torment." This isn't a hell that someone would continually choose over non-existence. Rather, Dante's hell is one filled with retributive justice---as it's gate states: "justice urged on my high artificer."

C.S. Lewis idea that sinners all choose to go to hell solves a tough theological problem. Maybe he's right, but it's noteworthy that his conception contradicts the medieval conception of hell as a place of divine retribution and torment.
