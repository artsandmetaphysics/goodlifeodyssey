  What would you do with a ring of invisibility?

Given a ring of invisibility, nobody "would be so adamant as to stick by justice and bring himself to keep away from what belongs to others and not lay hold of it, although he had license to take what he wanted from the market without fear, and to go into houses and have intercourse with whomever he wanted, and to slay or release from bonds whomever he wanted, and to do other things as an equal to a god among humans." So says Glaucon in book two of Plato's _Republic_.

What would I do with such a ring? I pondered this as I walked from the diner, where I ate breakfast, to the Met, where I'm writing this. Would I break into these well-kept brick townhouses to rape beautiful women? This is unappealing even to the basest part of me. Would I take what belongs to others? I'm fortunate, and "the possession of money contributes a great deal to not cheating or lying to any man against one's will." I have enough of everything, except reading time. Or so I say now, but would the ring increase my appetites? My work is meaningful most months, but after a bad quarter I may be tempted. "I'm spending my life in front of a computer, fooling myself into calling this my vocation." I could replace our index funds with a careful pick of stocks, guided by secrets I procure with the ring, and live freely. This isn't _really_ stealing, right? A few clever trades and I could fill my appetites: the _One Thousand and One Nights_, the remaining Classic Chinese Novels, the _Mahābhārata_---ten times as long as the _Iliad_, _The Tale of Genji_, all of Aristotle.

Then it occurs to me that I, like Frodo, should throw away the ring! But, Glaucon points out, if justice were good for its own sake, why would you need to? Discarding it would tell Thrasymachus that he's right and that justice is not an end but a means. He would say: "If justice were a good for itself, how could the ring lead you astray? Use the ring for good! Isn't Socrates always saying that injustice is ignorance, and that once the right path is known it will always be taken?"

If Thrasymachus said that, I would respond: "I think Socrates is mistaken. 'For I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate.' To throw away the ring is not to admit that justice is a means to the praise of men and other good things, but it is to admit my flawed nature. Blush again."
