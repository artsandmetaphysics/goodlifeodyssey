> Either all things come from one intelligent source and happen as in one body, and the part must not then complain of what is to the advantage of the Whole, or else all things are atoms and nothing but a medley and a dispersal. Why then are you perturbed? Say to your directing mind: "You are dead, you have decayed, you have been made a beast, you are an actor, you are joining the herd, and feeding like them."
> = (9.39)

> Either the gods have no power or they have power. If they have not, why do you pray? If they have, why not rather pray to be rid of fear and passion and grief for any of these things, rather than to have this and not that. In any case, if the gods can co-operate with men, it is with regard to these things.
> = (9.40)

> The revolutions of the cosmos are the same, up and down, through the ages. Either the mind of the Whole has an impulse which reaches to each individual---and if this be so, welcome that which is set in motion---or it had this impulse once, and the rest has followed in consequence. Why then are you anxious? The Whole either is a god, and all is well, or it is without plan---atoms somehow and indivisible particles---but you need not be without plan yourself.
> = (9.x)

> Either a universe with order and purpose or a medley thrown together by chance, but that too has order. Or can there be order of a kind in your inner world, but no order in the Whole, especially as all things are distinguished from one another, yet intermingle, and respond to each other?
> = (4.27)
