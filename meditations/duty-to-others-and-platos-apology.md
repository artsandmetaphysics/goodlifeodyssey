  Where does our duty to others begin? And _how_ should we help? Socrates' life, as presented in Plato's _Apology_, provides material for reflection.

Can a person be good yet spend all their time and money on themselves, their family, and their friends?

For example, my children are fed, educated, and even entertained. We own a house. We saved, so we won't need to work until we are bent. But there is always more. We want to travel, own art, and buy a summer home. Would it be selfish to continue spending mostly on ourselves?

I think so. But where does our _duty to others_ begin? And _how_ should we help?

Many Christians give a tenth of their income to the church or charity. This rule is reassuringly concrete, but as Jesus illustrated, the principle matters more than the particulars. Perhaps, on our good life odyssey, we must stop to answer these questions for ourselves. Plato's _Apology_, which I read this week, has helped me reflect on my duty to others. In it, Socrates defends himself before an Athenian jury and gives us his life as an example.

Socrates fulfilled his duty to others by urging the men of the city "like a father or an elder brother" to prize virtue more than their body or wealth. He believed, due to an oracle and a divine voice, that the gods sent him as a gift to make the city more excellent; he was like a gadfly stirring up a great and noble horse who had become sluggish. Although most of us don't have divine signs directing us, we can still learn from Socrates' example.

Socrates sacrificed to fulfill his duty to others. He neglected his personal affairs, even subjecting his wife and children to poverty. While he concedes that such neglect goes against human nature, he clearly was willing to sacrifice to fulfill his duty.  His commitment is further illustrated when, facing a death sentence, he refuses to grovel or reject his past behavior.

Socrates considered the impact of his actions. For example, he avoided political discourse because he knew it was dangerous. If I engaged in public affairs, "I should have died long ago, and benefited neither you nor myself." So although he didn't overvalue his life, he also didn't uselessly dispose of it.

Socrates thought life and wealth were good, but virtue was better. He may recognize the need to give to the poor and to heal the sick, but teaching the ignorant was more important. If we agree, perhaps our philanthropy should focus on education. This attitude seems presumptuous---who are we to think we can make people more excellent? But Socrates stresses he did not know what virtue or piety was, but rather that we should examine our lives. He even says "we should discuss virtue every day."

I think Socrates, as depicted in Plato's _Apology_, over-emphasizes the mind. Should we really discuss virtue every day? And is the unexamined life really "not worth living?" After being sentenced to death, he says that if he were to go to heaven, he would "spend my time testing and examining people there, as I do here, as to who among them is wise, and who thinks he is but is not." While I don't begrudge Socrates enjoying his work---after all, we will be more effective if we do---this comment suggests that Socrates' love of discourse leads him to value it too much.

Since I enjoy reading, thinking, and writing, I worry I will dally, pondering how best to help others instead of doing so. Unlike Socrates, I doubt we can precisely define goodness, piety, and justice, so ultimately we should stop thinking and start acting. Furthermore, the acting will improve our thinking.
