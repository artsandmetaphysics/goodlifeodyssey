This morning, while Elanor scribbled with her sixteen new crayons, I sifted through my new Alexander Pope translation of the _Iliad_. I read how Teuthras' son, Tydides, killed a good man from Arisbe and his loyal servant:

> Next Teuthras' son distain'd the sands with blood,
> Axylus, hospitable, rich, and good:
> In fair Arisbe's walls (his native place)
> He held his seat! a friend to human race.
> Fast by the road, his ever-open door
> Obliged the wealthy, and relieved the poor.
> To stern Tydides now he falls a prey,
> No friend to guard him in the dreadful day!
> Breathless the good man fell, and by his side
> His faithful servant, old Calesius, died.

I'd like to be a friend of the human race, opening my door and sharing wealth with those passing through my life, and so I identified with Axylus. His mortality became my mortality. I continued reading: Dresus is slain, then Opheltius with his twin children, then Polypoetes, then Pidytes. When reading Homer, you connect to a minor character and then move on, like the sad pauses you give acquaintances after learning they've passed away, yet Axylus kept returning to my mind. I decided write about him during Elanor's morning nap. Why did his death impact me so?

I'll be fortunate to end my life with a few deep relationships, having helped a few people. I'll be like a pebble tossed into the Atlantic, my ripples expanding and growing faint. All humans are mortal. I am human... I know I'll die.

Being able to talk logically about a truth isn't the same as being able to live consistently with that truth. Perhaps it's the difference between knowledge and wisdom. Wisdom can be found in many places---old people, hard experience, the movies, an obituary---but I suspect it's easiest to find in the classics.

My dad took me to an Orthodox Greek minister for therapy one summer. I'd broken up with my highschool girlfriend. The kind bearded man told me to read classic literature---Shakespeare. I was skeptical. What would he tell me that I didn't already know? My therapist knew he couldn't get to me with logic---he needed the wisdom of our great writers. I got over that girlfriend without Shakespeare's help, but maybe I would have gotten over her more quickly with it.
