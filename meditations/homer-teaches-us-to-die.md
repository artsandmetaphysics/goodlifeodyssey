This morning, while Elanor scribbled with her new box of sixteen crayons, I sifted through my new Alexander Pope translation of the _Iliad_. I read how Teuthras' son, Tydides, killed a good man from Arisbe and his servant:

> Next Teuthras' son distain'd the sands with blood,
> Axylus, hospitable, rich, and good:
> In fair Arisbe's walls (his native place)
> He held his seat! a friend to human race.
> Fast by the road, his ever-open door
> Obliged the wealthy, and relieved the poor.
> To stern Tydides now he falls a prey,
> No friend to guard him in the dreadful day!
> Breathless the good man fell, and by his side
> His faithful servant, old Calesius, died.

Like most of the men that die, no more is said of Axylus and Calesius, but this was enough to make me pause. Ten of Homer's lines are all that's left of old Calesius and Axylus, friend of the human race, friend of travelers.

I'd like to be a friend of the human race and to the passersby in my life, opening my doors and sharing the wealth I've been fortunate enough to make, and so I identify with the man. Once identified to the man, who stained the sands with his blood, his mortality becomes in my mortality.

Listening to the poem read, these passages rush by. Dresus is slain, then Opheltius with the twin children, then Polypoetes, then Pidytes. You make these brief connections, only to let them go, much like the brief pause you give to an old acquaintance who's passed away, when you read a note online, you let sadness enter your heart for a few minutes, and then you move on---the brevity of Homer's passages highlight our mortality and significance.

Of course I know I will die. I know I should feel lucky to have helped a few people and to have a few deep relationships that last to the end. I know these statements _rationally_. Homer's power, and the power of great literature, is to install truths and ideas at a deeper emotional level. I suspect Plato wrote dramatic dialogues, in part, because he understood this power, having grown up in a Homer-worshiping culture.
