  Can a good person focus only on oneself, family, and friends? What can we learn from Plato's _Apology_ regarding duty to humankind?

What do we owe wider humanity? Can a good person focus only on oneself, family, and friends?

For example, my career has been rewarding---our children are fed, educated, and even entertained. We own a house. We saved, so we won't need to work until we are bent. But we would like to travel, own art, and buy a summer home. 

Would it be selfish to continue spending nearly all our wealth on ourselves? I think it would be, and that we owe our surplus wealth and, what is more difficult, time, to others. But two difficult questions remain: What is surplus? And _how_ should we help others?

I read philosophy to try and answer these questions, and this week I read Plato's _Apology_---Socrates speech to the jury explaining that his annoying questions were his duty to his fellow Athenians.


Socrates' life exemplifies sacrifice for others. He neglects his personal affairs, living in poverty, so he can approach the men of the city "like a father or an elder brother" and persuade them to prize virtue more than their body or wealth. Socrates concedes that such neglect goes against human nature, and that if he were condemned, Athens would not easily replace him. So does Socrates expect others to act as he does?

- Viewed himself as a special case; gadfly on the horse
- Most people have other ways to contribute
- He had a voice and an oracle directing him
- (Also, he seems to admit that he enjoys philosophy)
- Where does this leave us?
- Certainly, Socrates would expect us to sacrifice our wealth, bodies, and even our lives to be excellent.
- There is no clear guidance on what being excellent means for us.

I thinkFurthermore, Socrates had a voice in his head guiding him, and an oracle from Delphi, so he believed his course was the right one.

I read a lot to try and answer these questions, but I enjoy reading. Am I dollying in the delight of reading ancient writers when I should be helping others?
