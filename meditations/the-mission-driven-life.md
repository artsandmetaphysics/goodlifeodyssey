  Where does our duty to others begin? And _how_ should we help? Socrates' life, as presented in Plato's _Apology_, provides material for reflection.

Can a person be good yet spend all their time and money on themself, family, and friends?

My children are fed, educated, and even entertained. We own a house. We saved, so we won't need to work until we are bent. But there is always more. We want to travel, own art, and buy a summer home. Would it be selfish to continue spending mostly on ourselves?

I think so. But where does our duty to others begin? And _how_ should we help?

Many Christians give a tenth of their income to the church or charity. This rule is reassuringly concrete, but as Jesus illustrated, the principle matters more than the particulars. Perhaps, on our good life odyssey, we must stop to answer these questions for ourselves. Plato's _Apology_, which I read this week, has helped me reflect on my duty to others. In it, Socrates' defends himself before an Athenian jury, letting us see how he lived.

Socrates fulfilled his duty to others by urging the men of the city "like a father or an elder brother" to prize virtue more than their body or wealth. He believed, due to an oracle and a divine voice, that the gods sent him as a gift to make the city more excellent; he was like a gadfly stirring up a great and noble horse who had become sluggish. Although most of us don't have divine signs directing us, we can still learn from Socrates' example.

Socrates sacrificed to fulfill his duty to others. He neglected his personal affairs, even subjecting his family to poverty. He concedes that such neglect goes against human nature and that if he were condemned, Athens would not easily replace him. Facing death, he compares himself to Achilles, who revenged Patroclus, despite knowing it would lead to his death, because he thought duty and honor more important than life. Thus, while I doubt Socrates wanted everyone to live in poverty, he sacrificed to fulfill his duty.

Socrates considered the impact of his actions. For example, he avoided political discourse because he knew it was dangerous. If I engaged in public affairs, "I should have died long ago, and benefited neither you nor myself." So although he didn't overvalue his life, he also didn't uselessly dispose of it.

Socrates thought life and wealth were good, but virtue was better. He may recognize the need to give to the poor and to heal the sick, but teaching the ignorant was more important. If we agree, perhaps our philanthropy should focus on education. This attitude seems presumptuous---who are we to think we can make people more excellent? But Socrates stresses he did not know what virtue or piety, but rather that we should examine our lives. He even says "we should discuss virtue every day."

I think Socrates, at least in Plato's _Apology_, over-emphasizes the mind. Can we expect everyone to discuss virtue every day? And is the unexamined life really "not worth living?" After Socrates is sentenced to death, he considers what may happen after death. If we go to heaven, he says he would "spend my time testing and examining people there, as I do here, as to who among them is wise, and who thinks he is, but is not." I suspect Socrates' love of discourse leads him to over-emphasize it.

I enjoy reading, thinking, and writing, so I worry that I am dallying in my delight of the ancient writers when I should be helping others. Is knowing the precise nature of virtue more important than being virtuous---and fulfilling our duty to others?
