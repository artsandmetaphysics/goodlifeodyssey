The Stoics claim that only things which are completely in our power to control can be _good_. Since our health, possessions, friends, and family are not completely in our control, none of them are good!

This view is so extreme it is natural to doubt that anyone actually held it. "You must be misunderstanding what the Stoics taught!" While we will never know how broadly held this view was, in the works of the three surviving Stoic writers---Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius---they profess to hold this view. Why?

The Stoics Because only the operations of the will are completely in our control, they are the only good.


, because our creator would not put us in a situation where we can not control whether good or evil occurs to us.

Defining _good_ in this way solves the problem of evil, but at great cost because it makes us indifferent to many things often deemed to be good. If a volcano erupted and buried your home town and entire extended family in ash, you could not say anything _bad_ occurred, since the eruption was out of your control. In other words, you must hold that family, friends, and material belongings are not good.

The eruption could not be good, because the divine controller of the inverse would not force something bad upon us.

This view is so extreme, one may doubt that anyone actually held it. Thus, I will present several quotes to show the stoics held this view, in writing if not in practice:

In the following quote, Epictetus divides things into two classes---those in our power and those not in our power, internals and externals. He then claims that only the first class is good. An anonymous skeptic pushes back, and so Epictetus considers two implications of holding the opposite view. The first is that we will be immoral. The second is that we will not love god.

> The operations of the will are in our power; not in our power are the body, the body's parts, property, parents, siblings, children, country or friends.
> Where should we put the good, then---to which of the two classes of things are we to assign it? To the class of things in our power. It follows that neither health nor fitness are good, nor are children, parents or country.
> "That view is not going to win you many friends or converts."
> Well, let's transfer the designation _good_ to health and other externals and see what happens. Suppose someone meets with misfortune and loses these _goods_; can they still be happy? "Impossible." You might ask, too, how they will remain on good terms with their neighbors, since we naturally incline to self-interest. And if it is in my interest to own land, it is in my interest to rob them of it. If it is in my interest to own a coat, it is in my interest to pinch one from the baths. There you have the genesis of wars, factions, and seditions.
> And how will I be able to stay right with God? Because if I'm harmed and meet with misfortune, I begin to doubt whether he is looking after me. And if he won't help me, why should I give him my regard? I want nothing to do with a god who allows me to be in my present state. So I begin to hate him, and wonder if the temples and statues we dedicate to him are not intended to placate a malignant force, like Fever. Honorary titles like _Savior_, _Rain-bringer_, and _Fruit-bringer_ are no longer applicable to him---and all this comes of identifying the _good_ with externals.
> -- Discourses, 1.22

I do not think either of Epictetus' scenarios follow from holding externals to be good. In the first case, just because we hold land and coats to be good does not mean we hold respecting our neighbor to be more good. In the second case, if there is good reason for God to let us fall into misfortune, we may withhold our hate.

> It is possible to depart from life at this moment. Have this thought in mind whenever you act, speak, or think. There is nothing terrible in leaving the company of men, if the gods exist, for they would not involve you in evil. If, on the other hand, they do not exist or do not concern themselves with human affairs, then what is life to me in a universe devoid of gods or of Providence? But they do exist and do care for humanity, and have put it altogether within a man's power not to fall into it. As for that which does not make a man worse, how could it make the life of man worse?
> Neither through ignorance nor with knowledge could the nature of the Whole have neglected to guard against this or correct it; nor through lack of power or skill could it have committed so great a wrong, namely that good and evil should come to the good and the evil alike, and at random. True, death and life, good and ill repute, toil and pleasure, wealth and poverty, being neither good nor bad, come to the good and the bad equally. They are therefore neither blessings nor evils.

What do we mean by the word _good_? Something we should pursue?

What did the stoics then, consider to be in good---the mind.

When is something in our control vs out of our control? The mind is not as in our control as the stoics thought. Discuss old age and drunkenness. Discuss how their view that mind was a substance, and that it could exist independently from the body, helped bolster their opinion that the mind was most important and fully independent.

In addition to the mind not being as much in our control as they thought, many other things which they treat as being out of our control are at least partly in our control. For example, they say our bodies are out of our control---but we can exercise. We can avoid danger. Our lives, due to technological and political progress, are much more in our control than could be deemed possible in ancient times.

Also, what makes the mind so good? They say you can retreat into your memories, but where do these memories come from but from outside experiences with the body and material possessions they dismiss.

The stoics thought the body was bad and the mind good. The body is a bag that drags down the mind, and while we have full control over the mind, we do not over the body.

Stick out your neck earnestly to be cut off! Who cares about the body.

The stoics must have been aware that the mind was affected by the body; Seneca speaks of drunkness and Marcus Aurelius of old age. I wonder what they would think about other mind-altering drugs.

What would a Stoic say after being convinced that the mind is nothing but matter, and that the mind is , facing believed that the mind was merely th
