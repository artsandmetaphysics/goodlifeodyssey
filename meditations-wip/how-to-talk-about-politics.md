Were Plato's dialogues read aloud for entertainment? Some speculate they were. Some are quite funny. Also, like ancient Greek plays, and unlike conversation in modern writing, they are bare dialogue. While can't imagine listening to Socrate's conversations read aloud at dinner, I've come to appreciate the format.

I've also come to appreciate _writing_ dialogue. Since you must impersonate both sides, it encourages reflection. It also lets you argue and rebut without commitment. This lack of commitment has frustrated centuries of scholars who've tried, with some success, to disentangle Plato's views from his characters. I wonder why we care what Plato thought? Shouldn't we evaluate the arguments---pick the ideas we think best?

Plato thought written dialogues could at best remind people of what they already knew. He, like Socrates,

Problem with written material: it can't defend itself.

Writing was just a reminder (Phaedrus 275c--576b).

I think dialogue with people that disagree with you is important. It helps one to empathize with others point of view; it also corrects mistaken assumptions.

But so often conversations about politics end poorly.

> Socrates:: Gorgias, I take it that you, like me, have experienced many discussions and that you've observed this sort of thing about them: it's not easy for participants to define jointly what they're undertaking to discuss, and so, having learned from and taught each other, to conclude their session. Instead, they're disputing some point and one maintains that the other isn't right or isn't clear, they get irritated, each thinking that the other is speaking out of spite. They become eager to win instead of investigating the subject under discussion. In fact, in the end some have a most shameful parting of the ways, abuse heaped upon them, having given and gotten to hear such things that make even the bystanders upset with themselves for having thought it worthwhile to come to list to such people.

> So, I'm afraid to pursue my examination with you, for fear that you should take me to be speaking with eagerness to win against you, rather than to have our subject become clear. For my part, I'd be pleased to continue questioning you if you're the same kind of man I am, otherwise I would drop it.

> And what kind of man am I? One of those who would be pleased to be refuted if I say anything untrue, and would be pleased to refute anyone who says anything untrue; one who, however, wouldn't be any less pleased to be refuted than to refute.


> The less you try to force a particular set of views on someone, the freer they’ll feel to reflect honestly on what they think—and maybe even revise their thinking down the line.

> Productive exchange is also more likely when there’s a mutual foundation of respect and friendship.

> In exchanges about fraught topics, she advises starting from the assumption that you won’t change the other person’s views, but she admits that may be easier said than done. “That balance between caring deeply, yet seeking to listen rather than change someone’s mind, is a knife’s-edge balance!”

> Whether you’re discussing the personal or the political, steer clear of language and behavior that signals contempt.

> The leaders who were most successful in overcoming others’ skepticism were those who diagnosed the root of the fundamental disagreement before trying to persuade. They first asked themselves, “What’s driving my detractor’s resistance?” These leaders often pinpointed which aspects of their arguments elicited the most pushback and the most emotional reactions. Then, depending on the answer, they approached the situation with one of the following three targeted strategies.
