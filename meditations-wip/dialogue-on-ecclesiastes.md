   A exploratory dialogue of _Ecclesiastes_ and the meaning of life.

B:: Did you find time to read and consider _Ecclesiastes_?

D:: I did---I read, reread, and considered it at great length. _Ecclesiastes_ has left a great impression on me.

B:: How so?

D:: It made me contemplate how I find meaning and purpose. If I may read the opening verses:

> The words of Koheleth son of David, king of Jerusalem.
>
> Utter futility!---said Koheleth---
> Utter futility! All is futile!
> What real value is there for a man
> In all the gains he makes beneath the sun?
> One generation goes, another comes,
> But the earth remains the same forever.

I think Koheleth is wrong. My life has real value. It isn't utterly futile, meaningless, or vain. It isn't "breath in the wind".

B:: You surprise me. Being a Christian, I also believe my life has value, but you are an atheist.

D:: Why does my suspicion that Abraham's God is man-made require me to also believe my life is meaningless?

I love my wife, have a caring family, and loyal friends. My labors give help those around me, and I hope will help future humans too. Thus my life can make a lasting contribution. I enjoy reading literature and history, looking at paintings, and listening to music---these connect me to those who lived before us. I appreciate the small joys of existence---light reflecting in water, milk mixing in coffee, the movement of my body, the grand buildings of our city, and others. I am healthy and hope to have a family. Pain and injustice have had no presence in my life.  But my privileged life may be leading me to doubt Koheleth’s claim---

B:: Koheleth had a more privileged life than you, so I doubt privilege is the source of your disagreement. Perhaps he was more aware of the less privileged---

D:: Koheleth says “I gained more wealth than anyone before me in Jerusalem” and that “I withheld from my eyes nothing they asked for, and denied myself no enjoyment."  But in many ways, my life is better than Koheleth's.

For example, are not our best musicians are better than Koheleth's?

B:: Why would they be?

D:: Technology has allowed our population to grow. More of of our lives are spent laboring with music than gathering food. And technology has made our instruments louder and clearer. We can record our compositions, copy them, and have accumulated an expansive variety of music to play and practice. For these reasons, our best musicians are better than  Koheleth's.

B:: Your explanation is convincing.

D:: And can I attend, due to my privilege, these musician’s performances as often as I desire. Furthermore, the performances are held in buildings constructed to make the music sound as best as possible.

I can listen to recordings of our best musicians at my whim---even outside surrounded by natural beauty.  All of these gains are made by the labors of those before us.

I am also more privileged than Koheleth with regards to---

B:: I agree! If I don’t, you will continue producing examples. You have discussed music, but you our food also better and more varied. For example, my city has exotic fish flown in from across the world and prepared by experts in inventive ways. I can eat these fish for less than a small part of my day’s wages. Our culinary tools are better and our farming techniques are advanced. We also have more access to the visual and literary arts than Koheleth.

I maintain that Koheleth, relative to the people around him, was more privileged than you, I also agree that a moderately privileged person today is more comfortable than even the kings of old.

But do any of these observations alter Koheleth’s argument? We still die today. We still grow sick. Injustice, while perhaps less common, is still abundant. If Koheleth lived today, would he abandon his argument? I think not.

D:: By "abandon his argument", what do you mean? Have we agreed on what Koheleth’s argument is?

B:: Here is how I would summarize Koheleth’s argument:

All of us will die---the wise and the foolish, the righteous and the wicked. Our lives are like mere breath---short and without lasting impact or meaning---and there is no reason to believe in a meaningful afterlife. Thus, what value is there for a man in all the gains he makes beneath the sun? There is none! So eat, drink, and enjoy your loved ones if and while you are able, knowing that death, oppression, or misfortune may take them away. God controls everything and his reasons are unknowable. When you die, you may hope to pass along your good things to your children, but your children may be fools. You may hope to be remembered, but you will be forgotten. All is merest breath!

D:: I like your summary, but others would not---you are applying your own interpretation to the text.

B:: Of course I am. To summarize is to omit, and to judge what may be omitted one must interpret the text. Ecclesiastes has often been called the most challenging and unique book in the Old Testament. It was said to nearly have been omitted by the rabbis who established the canon.

There are a few interpretations of Ecclesiastes, each treating the difficult sections of the book in its own way.

D:: What do you mean by difficult sections?

B:: I mean the sections that seem counter to what the rest of the Bible teaches. The overwhelming pessimism, as evidenced in the opening words is one example. Another can be found near the end of chapter 3. I will read it:

> I mused: “God will doom both righteous and wicked, for there is a time for every experience and for every happening.” So I decided, as regards men, to dissociate them from the divine beings and to face the fact that they are beasts. For in respect of the fate of man and the fate of beast, they have one and the same fate: as the one dies so dies the other, and both have the same lifebreath; man has no superiority over beast, since both amount to nothing. Both go to the same place; both came from dust and both return to the dust. Who knows if a man’s lifebreath does rise upward and if a beast’s breath does sink down into the earth?
>
> I saw that there is nothing better for man than to enjoy his possessions, since that is his portion. For who can enable him to see what will happen afterward?

How do we interpret this passage in Ecclesiastes? Koheleth says that man is no better than beasts, but this contrasts with the central view of humans within God’s creation, as expressed in the Psalms and Genesis.

One difficulty in this passage can be explained by the concept of “progressive revelation.” Have you heard of this?

D:: I have, but I would like to hear you explain it.

B:: I believe God revealed his plan for the redemption of humanity in stages. Since his revelation commenced in stages, and because the Bible does not say as much, there is no reason to think Abraham knew the ten commandments or Moses was aware of the general resurrection. Similarly, Koheleth and other Old Testament writers believed all the dead went to the thoughtless Sheol because God had not revealed the existence of heaven or hell yet.

D:: Is this why the psalmist says “What is to be gained from my death, from my descent into the Pit? Can dust praise you?”

B:: Precisely---the psalmist was unaware of a meaningful life after death, and assumed that his relationship with God ended when he died. Thus progressive revelation explains Koheleth’s ignorance of a meaningful afterlife.  It is more difficult to explain why Koheleth says humans are mere beasts---this appears to contradict foundational beliefs that were revealed and known long before his time.

Let me read another difficult passage:

> In my own brief span of life, I have seen both these things: sometimes a good man perishes in spite of his goodness, and sometimes a wicked one endures in spite of his wickedness. So don’t overdo goodness and don’t act the wise man to excess, or you may be dumbfounded. Don’t overdo wickedness and don’t be a fool, or you may die before your time. It is best that you grasp the one without letting go of the other, for one who fears God will do his duty by both.

It is difficult to imagine Mosses agreeing with this.

D:: Thank you for providing examples of difficult passages. I read these and conclude that Koheleth had different beliefs than other writers of the Old Testament.

B:: Some Christians would agree with you, but I believe that God is in full control of the process that lead to the Bible as we know it. He inspired the authors of the texts, he inspired those who selected the texts to include in the Bible, and he watched over those who transcribed the texts. Thus, I believe that the text we have today has to be what God wanted it to be. It is difficult to understand why God would allow some passages of the Bible to disagree with others. However, there are interpretations that explain these difficulties.

One interpretation is that Koheleth is describing the conclusions that someone would draw if they did not believe in God. In this line of thinking, the phrase “beneath the sun” is meant to distinguish the realm and logic of man from the logic of God. Thus, when Koheleth says “there is nothing new beneath the sun,” he means that anything new comes only from God. I do not find this interpretation to be compelling because this distinction does not seem to be clearly made throughout the book. I find it more likely that “beneath the sun” refers to the living, as opposed to the dead, who are in Sheol and are no longer under the sun. Someone who interpreted Ecclesiastes this way would disagree with my summary.

A second interpretation---and one that I find more convincing---believes that Koheleth’s argument is being presented for consideration, but is incorrect and incomplete. According to this line of reasoning the author of Ecclesiastes is not Koheleth. This is apparent from the epilogue at the end of chapter twelve:

A further word: Because Koheleth was a sage, he continued to instruct the people. He listened to and tested the soundness of many maxims. Koheleth sought to discover useful sayings and recorded genuinely truthful sayings. The sayings of the wise are like goads, like nails fixed in prodding sticks. They were given by one Shepard.

> A further word: Against them my son, be warned!
>
> The making of many books is without limit
> And much study is a wearying of the flesh.
>
> The sum of the matter, when all is said and done: Revere God and observe his commandments! For this applies to all mankind: that God will call every creature to account for everything unknown, be it good or bad.

Some interpret the author of the epilogue to be cautioning the reader not to listen to everything he says, even though his message is worthy of consideration.

And of course, there are many other interpretations that deal with these difficulties in various ways, some more plausible than others.

D:: As a non-believer, I am primarily interested in how Koheleth’s statements are relevant to me. Thus, I could read freely into the text searching for meaning, whether intended by the author or not, and I gained value regardless.

The original intent of the book, and how it fits with the rest of the Bible, are secondary concerns for me. They only become relevant as in the context of me considering whether the Bible is inspired or inerrant.

Thus, while the two difficult passages you are discussing caught my eye, I did not pause to consider them at length.

B:: That is only natural for you to read Ecclesiastes in this way. I hope my discussion of the interpretations has not been tedious---

D:: Not at all! It is fascinating. You have discussed the tension between Ecclesiastes and the other books of the bible, but I would also like to discuss the internal tensions. For example, it seems that Koheleth’s own views shift around throughout the book. I have no issue with this---after all, the book may not be meant to be a logically precise treatise---but I am curious how these shifting attitudes are understood by Christian interpreters.

B:: Perhaps we can discuss the internal tensions some other time? Now that we have a tentative interpretation of Ecclesiastes, I would like to return to our earlier line of thinking.

You have convinced me that, in many ways your life is better than Koholeth’s. But, does this observation alter the validity of Koheleth’s message to you as a non-believer?

D:: I do. Koheleth did not believe that humans could make progress apart from God. As he says:

> All streams flow into the sea,
> Yet the sea is never full;
> To the place from which they flow
> The streams flow back again.
> All such things are wearisome:
> No man can ever state them;
> The eye never has enough of seeing,
> Nor the ear enough of hearing.
> Only that shall happen
> Which has happened,
> Only that occur
> Which has occurred;
> There is nothing new
> Beneath the sun!
>
> Sometimes there is a phenomena of which they say, “Look, this one is new!”---it occurred long since, in ages that went by before us. The earlier ones are not remembered; so too those that will occur later will no more be remembered than those that will occur at the very end.

His belief in the impossibility of human progress is of central importance, because with it comes the belief that the observations he made of the world would remain true forever. He assumes there will always be the oppressed without those to comfort them, that uncertainty and injustice were immutable facts.

As it turns out, Koheleth’s was wrong---humanity has made a great deal of progress and many significant and new things have been discovered. As we have seen, my life is more comfortable than Koheleth’s due to the labors of many over the intervening centuries.

Here is another example: Koheleth says:

> Just as you do not know how the lifebreath passes into the limbs within the womb of the pregnant woman, so you cannot foresee the actions of God, who causes all things to happen.

While it is true that we cannot foresee the actions of God, our understanding of how the lifebreath passes into the limbs within the womb is growing ever more complete due to our understanding.

I derive meaning from my contributions to furthering the progress of humanity. I believe that with sustained efforts we may reach a point in time when many of Koheleth’s dismal observations will no longer be true. In particular, we may some day live much longer lives with less uncertainty. There may no longer be any oppressed people with nobody to comfort them.

Thus, even though I do not believe in an afterlife or divine justice, I see real value in our gains beneath the sun and I hope for a better future for our ancestors. I think Koheleth was overly pessimistic.

B:: I am very glad that you can find meaning in your life. I also find your altruistic attitude commendable---that you believe the hope for future human progress is enough to give you meaning and purpose, even if you know you will die. Even so, I have three objections.

First, you are laboring for a better future, but do your contributions provide you any real value since you will not be around to see it?

D:: If one is utterly selfish, then there is no value.

I think even Koheleth would say there is some value in what comes after your own life, for after listing out his great wealth, he says:

> I withheld from my eyes nothing they asked for, and denied myself no enjoyment; rather, I got enjoyment out of all my wealth. And that was all I got out of my wealth. Then my thoughts turned to all the fortune my hands had built up, to the wealth I had acquired and won---and oh, it was all futile and pursuit of wind; there was no real value under the sun! For what will the man be like who will succeed the one who is ruling over what was built up long ago?

This rhetorical question implies that, if he knew his successors would be wise and would not squander is wealth, there would be value in his gains. Therefore he tacitly recognizes that if progress were possible, it would be of value. But he does not believe progress is possible---empires rise and fall, and human progress is temporary because your future successor may be a fool. Of course he does believe God can make progress, as he says in chapter 6:

> Whatever happens, it was designated long ago and it was known that it would happen; as for man, he cannot contend with what is stronger than he. Often, much talk means much futility. How does it benefit a man? Who can possibly know what is best for a man to do in life---the few days of his fleeting life? For who can tell him what the future holds for him under the sun?

B:: Your reasoning seems sound, although I suspect you are putting too much weight on one verse.

D:: Perhaps, although remember---while I am engaging with the text, I do not feel bound by the text. Regardless of what Koheleth would say, I believe there is value in contributing to the future even.

B:: I can accept that. Well, then I shall move on to my second objection. I think the hope you place in human progress is misplaced. After all, do you think our technological advancements make us significantly happier?

D:: Before answering this, let me ask another question: Do you think Koheleth concluded that all is futile because his life was finite, or because there is nothing of real value under the sun? Said another way: If Koheleth could have lived forever would have found real value in his gains under the sun?

B:: You make an insightful distinction. I see how it relates to my question. If Koheleth’s primary concern is the shortness of life, then it would seem he agrees with you. In other words, he enjoyed life as it is, but he wanted it to keep on going. If, on the other hand, Koheleth’s complaint is that nothing in this life is of real value, then even if we lived forever, there would be no “real value” under the sun and to have a meaningful life, we would have to reach out into the next life.

As a Christian, my first impulse is to say that Koheleth thought there is no real value in this life. But when I think back on the book, he does emphasize death consistently---

D:: He does indeed! Although I doubt that we can confidently deduce how Koheleth would have answered this question. His writing is not systematic enough nor do I think he considered this distinction. After all, while aware of the concept of a meaningful afterlife, he does not appear to believe or consider it in his writings.

Perhaps this passage in chapter nine, where I think he outlines his argument most systematically, is most relevant to this investigation:

> That is the sad thing about all that goes on under the sun: that the same fate is in store for all. (Not only that, but men’s hearts are full of sadness, and their minds of madness, while they live; and then---to the dead!) For he who is reckoned among the living has something to look forward to---even a live dog is better than a dead lion---since the living know they will die. But the dead know nothing; they have no more recompense, for even the memories of them has died. Their loves, their hates, their jealousies have long since perished; and they have no more share till the end of time in all that goes on under the sun.
>
> Go eat your bread in gladness, and drink your wine in joy; for your action was long ago approved by God. Let your clothes always be freshly washed, and your head never lack ointment. Enjoy happiness with a woman you love all the fleeting days of life that have been granted to you under the sun---all your fleeting days. For that alone is what you can get out of life and out of the means you acquire under the sun. Whatever it is in your power to do, do with all your might. For there is no action, no reasoning, no learning, no wisdom in Sheol, where you are going.

When he says “men’s hearts are full of sadness, and their minds of madness, while they live,” is this sadness an inevitable component of human nature, or is it due to the pain, death, and uncertainty he observed in the world around him---the very things I think human progress can slowly eliminate?

B:: I think there are other passages which are more relevant. Consider this passage in chapter one:

> I, Koheleth, was king in Jerusalem over Israel. I set my mind to study and to probe wisdom and all that happens under the sun.---An unhappy business, that, which God gave me to be concerned with! I observed all the happenings beneath the sun, and I found that all is futile and pursuit of wind: A twisted thing that cannot be made straight, a lack that cannot be made good.

What is the twisted thing referring to? Is it human nature or the state of the world as Koheleth saw it?

And then, perhaps most relevant of all, is the first part of chapter six:

> There is an evil I have observed under the sun, and a grave one it is for man: that God sometimes grants a man riches, property, and wealth, so that he does not want for anything his appetite may crave, but God does not permit him to enjoy it; instead a stranger will enjoy it. That is futility and a grievous ill. Even if a man should beget a hundred children and live many years---no matter how many the days of his years may come to, if his gullet is not sated through his wealth, I say: The stillbirth, though it was not even accorded a burial, is more fortunate than he. Though it comes into futility and departs into darkness, and its very name is covered with darkness, though it has never seen or experienced the sun, it is better off than he---yes, even if the other lived a thousand years twice over but never had his fill of enjoyment! For are not both of them bound for the same place? All of man’s earning is for the sake of his mouth, yet his gullet is not sated.

It seems to me that Koheleth is stating that, even if you live a thousand years, you will not be satisfied.

D:: I read and considered this passage carefully, and although I see why you may interpret it the way you do, I think it is an incorrect interpretation. Why does the opening verse say the man “does not want for anything his appetite may crave,” if it turns out he can never satisfy himself? And when he says “even if he lived a thousand years twice over but never had his fill of enjoyment,” why does he include the qualification “but never had his fill of enjoyment”?

B:: It is not clear, but before you continue---how do you explain the last verse: “All of man’s earning is for the sake of his mouth, yet his gullet is not sated.” This seems quite clear.

D:: I will return to the last verse in a moment. I think that these verses are expressing the idea that you can not judge a man’s life until they have died. This idea seemed to be commonly held in the ancient near east, even though I find it rather silly. Perhaps the best example of it is found in Herodotus’s story of Solon the wise man and Croesus the rich king. Croesus invites Solon to his quart and asks him who the happiest man in the world is, and gets frustrated when Solon names some nobody from his hometown of Athens. The Solon tells Croesus something like “You are very rich, but I will not say whether you are happy until you have died. Great wealth can make a man no happier than moderate means, unless he has the luck to continue in prosperity until the end.”

I think it is better to interpret these verses in light of this. This explains why he includes the qualification “but never had his fill of enjoyment”---he is saying that even if you live an incredibly long and fulfilled life, if it ends badly everything is for naught. I think the last verse is just restating this, although even so it is hard to understand.

B:: Interesting analysis. I don’t agree with your interpretation of these verses, but it is difficult to explain the qualification.

D:: It is hard to know if one is reading too much into the passages.

B:: It is. As a Christian I have other texts to draw my conclusions from.

D:: And as I have said, I do not feel bound by the text. How would you answer our question? Do you believe that if we lived forever, we could find real value and meaning in our lives?

B:: As I implied in my question---do our technological advancements make us happier---I believe our human nature is corrupted with sin. Technologically advanced people still enslave and kill one another. In fact, much technological progress is invented to help us fight one another.

And when new technologies emerge which make our lives more comfortable, most of us adjust our expectations quickly and simply crave more. Our “gullet is not sated.”

D:: You are right that many of us are unhappy, despite our historical privilege. It is not clear whether we are happier than our ancestors. What is clear is that technological progress does less to make us happier than one may expect.

Moving away from observations of the outside world to a more personal approach, I can say for certain that I am incredibly happy---joyful even. Furthermore, I believe my happiness is possible in part because of new technologies. My happiness comes from four primary places. My relationships---with my wife, friends, and family, my connection with our ancestors, through literature, history, art, and music, my enjoyment and meaning I find in my work, and finally my appreciation of every day sensory experiences. My happiness is a sort of mystical experience---I can’t quite transfer my knowledge of it to you. But since I know I am so happy, it makes me optimistic I can pass it along to others.

B:: You say your happiness is made possible by new technologies, but how?

D:: I am not certain as to why, but I will try to give as best an explanation as I can. First, I must explain how I conceptualize the source of “meaning”.

Where does meaning in language come from? Does the meaning of a word originate in the physical world? Or is meaning internal to a language---words are defined with other words in a big circular web? I suspect the answer is a combination of both. Some less-abstract words are more directly rooted in the physical world, while others are built up from less abstract words. Very abstract words, such as “meaning” or “purpose” are built up using a recursive web of meaning, but ultimately, they describe complex patterns of matter in space and time.

In a similar manner, I think “meaning” or “real value” as discussed by Koheleth ourselves, is built up from a recursive web that is also rooted in simple sensory experiences. For example, my wedding day is meaningful because of the relationship I have with my wife and family. A stranger’s wedding day is somewhat less meaningful. Especially if you work at weddings and see several each week. My relationship with my wife is in turn built up from many conversations, dates, and shared experiences. Each of these experiences is further built up from earlier experiences. For example, imagine we discuss food and cooking. This discussion’s meaning is further rooted in experiences eating and cooking throughout our life. The meaning in my relationships with my family is built up in a similar way.

I enjoy looking at paintings. When, I see a new painting, meaning is built up from the visual picture. But it is also built up through an understanding of the artist, the life context in which they painted it. Sometimes meaning comes from other paintings which are visually similar, or even the museum or collector who donated the work. Meaning also comes from the place of the painting in history. Interestingly, over the years as I have seen more artwork and visited more museums and have developed a broader understanding of art history, I have found it easier to connect and find meaning in paintings.

Similarly, an athletic contest is more meaningful to someone who has a connection to either team, understands the rules of the game, knows how the game’s outcome affects the season, or knows about the athletes.

I believe the hierarchical accumulation of meaning has some implications for our discussion. In particular, I do not believe “meaning” or “value,” as we use the words under the sun, is a discrete metaphysical concept. While I agree that some actions are more meaningful than others, I don’t believe it is because they have more of this innate metaphysical quantity. Thus, while a typical day at work is less meaningful than your wedding day, we must not disparage the typical day. It and other small experiences like it are the foundation upon which meaning is derived.

One way that technology has increased my happiness is by giving me the opportunity to broaden and deepen this great web of meaning. I have had the opportunity to understand the laws of physics and mathematics, which give me a greater appreciation of the physical phenomena around us. This understanding makes appreciate the beauty of the world. I also have been able to read great writers from the past and connect with humans spanning back to many millennia. I frequently feel a deep sense of joy when I read poetry or literature from the past. As is the case with my understanding of painting, so too the more I learn about the ancient world, the more meaningful and powerful my connections with it grow.

All of this is possible because our civilization has the resources, which technology has enabled, to make literature, art, music, and more available to its regular citizens.

I could continue with many more examples, but I have been talking a while now.

B:: Thank you for your detailed explanation.

Bits and Pieces

You must appreciate that I believe the book is inspired by God. When I read it, I believe that God is communicating me his will for my life. Thus, it is important for me to understand how the difficult passages fit with the rest of the bible.

Like the author of the epilogue, I believe God will call everyone into account. And, while Koheleth says “who knows if a man’s lifebreath does rise upward?” I believe in new revelations God has given us and thus that we do know that the lifebreath rises upward! “He also puts eternity in their mind, but without man ever guessing, from first to last, all the things that God brings to pass.” Jesus’s resurrection came to pass! Koheleth did not have these revelations, and thus, while he believes in God, he does not believe in an afterlife or in the just punishment of the wicked.

If, for my life to be more than a breath of wind, it must last forever, then I agree with Koheleth. But is eternal life necessary for us to be content? I wish my life were much longer than it likely will be, but would 1000 lifetimes not be sufficient?

- discussion of absolute vs relative meaning; how does god give meaning if we don't give ourselves meaning; mystical answer; ("as we have discussed many times before")

Also compare to absolute justice; justice is an external factor---God makes the justice real by punishing the "wicked" as defined by God. Since meaning and purpose are internal, it does not seems possible that God could somehow create meaning directly in the same way. Perhaps God could allow us to live forever, and somehow being able to live forever is the cause of meaning. This seems unlikely to me. God could also institute other mystical changes in how reality is experienced which would result in there being meaning. Also, what about a relationship with God? Could that create meaning? Well, if we assume our physical form is not changed, then what do relationships look like? There are sexual relationships with our wives. That seems odd even to consider. However, this sexual relationship does create more meaning since it is (or should be) a unique experience that two people have with each other. The sensation of sex is unique. The production of children together is even more amazing than the sexual part (to me). Putting aside our taboos of thinking about sex, and our natural inclination to disassociate a holy thing God from this, it seems possible there could be something equivalent to sex that is unique and different, which we can not conceive of on Earth, which would provide more meaning and purpose to our lives than what Koheleth was able to find here.
