Socrates:: Is it, then, the part of a just man to harm any human being whatsoever?

Polemarchus:: Certainly, bad men and enemies ought to be harmed.

Socrates:: Do horses that have been harmed become better or worse?

Polemarchus:: Worse.

Socrates:: With respect to the _aretē_ of dogs or to that of horses?

Polemarchus:: With respect to that of horses.

Socrates:: And when dogs are harmed, do they become worse with respect to the _aretē_ of dogs and not to that of horses?

Polemarchus:: Necessarily.

Socrates:: Should we not assert the same of human beings, my comrade---that when they are harmed, they become worse with respect to human _aretē_?

Polemarchus:: Most certainly.

Socrates:: But isn't justice human _aretē_.

Polemarchus:: That's also necessary.

Socrates:: Then, my friend, human beings who have been harmed necessarily become more unjust.

Polemarchus:: It seems so.

Socrates:: Well, are musicians able to make men unmusical by music?

Polemarchus:: Impossible.

Socrates:: Are men skilled in horsemanship able to make men incompetent riders by horsemanship?

Polemarchus:: That can't be.

Socrates:: But are just men to make others unjust by justice, of all things? Or, in sum, are good men able to make other men bad by _aretē_?

Polemarchus:: Impossible.

Socrates:: For I suppose that cooling is not the work of heat, but of its opposite.

Polemarchus:: Yes.

Socrates:: Nor wetting the work of dryness but of its opposite.

Polemarchus:: Certainly.

Socrates:: Nor is harming, in fact, the work of the good but of its opposite.

Polemarchus:: It looks like it.

Socrates:: And it's the just man who is good?

Polemarchus:: Certainly.

Socrates:: Then it is not the work of the just man to harm either a friend or anyone else, Polemarchus, but of his opposite, the unjust man.

Polemarchus:: In my opinion, Socrates, what you say is entirely true.

Dijon:: My opinion, Socrates, is not yet formed. Would you be willing to help me complete it by answering a few questions?

Socrates:: I will try.

Dijon:: Why do you think music and horsemanship can teach us about justice?

Socrates:: Music is the _aretē_ of musicians, horsemanship the _aretē_ of men skilled in horsemanship, and justice the _aretē_ of humans. Thus, if we observe certain truths about music and horsemanship, we may reason that there are similar truths about justice too, for all three share the same essential nature as types of _aretē_.

Dijon:: Do you agree that music and horsemanship are unique arts?

Socrates:: Certainly.

Dijon:: Then couldn't these observed truths, for example that musicians can't make men unmusical by music, be due their unique nature?

Socrates:: No, because each art provides another example. Can a poet make men less poetic with poetry?

Dijon:: A masterful poet could scare ambitious young people away from his art, causing them to despair of ever scaling their pinnacle of greatness?

Socrates:: This isn't entirely implausible, but wouldn't the ambitious young still love poetry more for having observed the master's greatness?

Dijon:: Maybe, but is the _aretē_ of poets to listen to poetry or to write it?

When you harm a horse, how is its horse _aretē_ decreased?

Socrates:: I do not know the _aretē_ of horses well, but they must be able to take their rider long distances quickly---now still, now galloping like lightning---like the great breed of Tros' team, whom Diomedes wrested from Aeneas and who won him a slave woman in the great funeral games of Patroclus. Would even one of these excellent horses, given by Zeus for Ganymede, have been as excellent if Diomedes' spear had pierced its leg instead of splitting through Pandarus' jaw?

Dijon:: Indeed not, and so when you speak of human _aretē_ being decreased by harm, do you mean the same type of harm?

Socrates:: The _aretē_ of men is different than the _aretē_ of horses, and so men can be harmed by more than spears, swords, and boulders.

Dijon:: Yet physical harm will make a man worse with respect to human _aretē_?

Socrates:: Yes.

Dijon:: And since justice is human _aretē_, if a man is caught abusing widows and orphans and is beaten with a plank and whipped, does this beating with a plank and whipping make the man less just?

Socrates:: It looks like it.

Dijon:: It seems that you are using the word "just" in a different sense than I usually use the word. Perhaps I am only confused about this.

Isn't it possible that the man's punishment would lead him to consider his error, thus making him better with respect to human _aretē_? While physical harm may not make horses better, it doesn't seem to follow that physical harm can't make humans better. Wouldn't you agree that not _all_ harm is bad?

Socrates:: I do not. Can a punishment, intended to improve the person, be properly called a harm? When Simonedes says to help your friends and harm your enemies, he must have meant killing your enemies, stealing their cattle, and making their wives your slaves.

Dijon:: Consider, then, that the widow and orphan abuser is stoned to death. Couldn't the stoning, while unable to make the abuser more just, serve to make others more just by example?
