Dijon:: Excuse me. I am on my way through Athens. I saw this stream and, being a hot afternoon, decided to leave the path and walk along its banks. As I approached this tall tree, the faint echoes of your voices rose above the cicadas. You were so busy with your intercourse that you didn't hear me. And so I've been standing here, leaning against this tree, listening for some time. Part of me wanted to interrupt, but part of me couldn't pull away. Then, just now, you said something I couldn't bear.

Old Man:: What was so unbearable that you had to interrupt our dialogue with this speech of your own?

Dijon:: You said the written word can do no more than remind us of what we already know. If you were attacked unfairly, wouldn't it be just for your pupils come to your aid? Likewise, I must come to the aid of my greatest teacher---the written word. It has taught me most of what I know.

Old Man:: I shall try to explain. Writing shares a strange feature with painting. Paintings stand there as if they are alive, but if anyone asks them anything, they remain most solemnly silent. The same is true of written words. You'd think they were speaking as if they had some understanding, but if you question anything that has been said because you want to learn more, it continues to signify just that very same thing forever. And when it is faulted and attacked unfairly, it always needs its father's support; alone, it can neither defend itself nor come to its own support.

Therefore, if you read and understand written words, then you already had the knowledge needed to understand it. If you read and don't understand written words, you will have nobody to question. Therefore, written words can only remind us of what we already know.

Young Man:: Well said. You are absolutely right about this.

Old Man:: We need a more capable discourse, one that is written down, with knowledge, in the soul of the listener. We need a discourse that can defend itself.

Young Man:: You mean the living, breathing discourse of the man who knows, of which the written one can be fairly called an image.

Old Man:: That's absolutely right. The dialectician chooses a proper soul and plants and sows within it discourse accompanied by knowledge---discourse capable of helping itself as well as the man who planted it, which is not barren but produces a seed from which more discourse grows in the character of others. Such discourse makes the seed forever immortal and renders the man who has it as happy as any human can be.

Dijon:: Well, this is what I've read. Among the ancient scribes of Egypt, there is one who wrote the following:

"As for those wise writers from the time after the gods, they who foretold what was to come, their names have become everlasting, even though they have departed this life and all their relatives are forgotten.

"They gave themselves a book as their lector-priest, a writing-board as their dutiful son. Teachings are their mausoleum, the reed-pen their child, the burnishing-stone their wife. Both great and small are given them as their children, for the writing is chief.

"Be a writer, take it to heart, so that _your_ name will fare likewise. A book is more effective than a carved tombstone or a permanent sepulcher. They serve as chapels and mausoleum in the mind of him who proclaims their names. A name on people's lips will surely be effective in the afterlife!

"Is there one here like Hordedef? Is there another like Imhotep? None of our kin is like Neferti or Khety, their leader. May I remind you about Ptahemdjehuty and Khakheperraseneb! Is there another like Ptahhotep, or the equal of Kairsu?

"Those wise men who foretold what was to come: what they said came into being; it is found as a maxim, written in their books Other's offspring will be their heirs, as if they were their own children. They hid their magic from the world, but it is read in their teachings. They are gone, their names forgotten; but writings cause them to be remembered."

Young Man:: Do you really believe an ancient scribe wrote this?

Dijon:: I do believe it, for scholars from my land dug up the scroll this was written on, and many like it, and learned how to read them. And so, having relayed this ancient account, I'd like to question your older companion: Why would the scribe praise Hordedef, Imhotep, Neferti, Khety, Ptahemdjehuty, Khakheperraseneb, Ptahhotep, and Kairsu if their writings merely reminded him of what he already knew?

Old Man:: The teachings of these ancient wise men and prophets were planted in the souls of their contemporaries, and they grew like reeds, slowly at first, until they covered the banks of the Nile. As the great river flooded and receded, and as pharaohs conquered and were conquered, these reeds swayed back and forth in the muddy waters. And so, the meaning of these sayings were planted in the soul of this scribe by his mother, father, and grandmother long before he could read the names "Hordedef" or "Ptahhotep."

In fact, some of the sayings attributed to these wise men were not their own; they were planted by forgotten souls, who by ascribing their wisdom to these great names were used them to fertilize their own reeds.

Dijon:: I see that I have not convinced you. Imagine that this scribe is struck deaf and dumb by Ammon for attributing immortality to the written word. He dies, and in the afterlife he meets the sage Ptahhotep. He writes a note on a piece of papyrus:

"Vizier Ptahhotep, I prostrate myself before you, my superior. I have read your many teachings and taught them to my sons. As you know, they are on the lips of all lovers of wisdom in Egypt. Most of your sayings I could understand on my own, however, all my life I have had a question about one of them that nobody has been able to answer to my satisfaction. I can not speak or hear, but if you would deem to write responses on this papyrus, I would be honored and delighted to know your answer."

The vizier, Ptahhotep, writes: "I will answer."

Our deaf and dumb scribe bows very low, and without lifting his head he writes:

"Your thirty-first maxim says:

> Do not have sex with a boy
> when you know that what is condemned will satisfy his desire.
> There is no cooling his lust.
> Let him not spend the night doing what is condemned:
> he will cool down only after he has mastered his desire.

"This practice, of older men having sex with boys, is universally rejected in my time. Yet you speak against it as if it was common. This leads me to ask: does right and wrong change?"

He hands the papyrus to Ptahhotep, who fills the papyrus with symbols none of us would understand, and places it on the ground in front of our scribe, whose head is still bowed. Our scribe begins reading. He reads of a middle path, explained to Ptahhotep by the gods of the underworld, that demonstrates how right and wrong changes in some ways but is fixed in other ways by the structure of the universe. Our scribe is so awed and frenzied by the response that he doesn't that Ptahhotep slowly walks away into the distance.

Our scribe reads the dialogue over and over again, studying its beautiful parts. But then he remembers Ammon's chastisement, and having already memorized its contents, he throws the papyrus back into the Styx, thus returning the reeds to where he'd harvested them.

Centuries after this meeting, a living man enters Hades, crosses the Styx and asks Anubis to return his young wife to him. The man pleads and plays a song that is so beautiful, Anubis relents. The song is so beautiful that our Egyptian scribe, standing behind a dingy crowd of bloodless onlookers, could hear the melody. He weeps for joy.

At this moment, he decides to repay the musician, not knowing that he would ultimately be his greatest curse. He seeks the musician's young wife, and gives her two papyri. The first reads: "Your husband has come for you and swayed Annubis to once again weave your fate. The second papyrus I've given you contains a great secret, which will make you and your husband live forever." She takes the gift and is reunited with her husband. "Do not look back," Annubis tells the musician, "or you're wife will need to remain in the underworld." As their two souls climb steeply from the fog and darkness, the god realizes the secret of right and wrong is about to leave his domain, and so he wills him to look back. Woe is the young wife, whose spirit falls away! Woe is the musician! Woe is our, woe is our scribe, who never repented from his love of writing or his belief that it gives one immortality! It saddens me to think of the punishment he must bear for his transgression.

I've had the very same questions that our scribe asked Ptahhotep. Do you think, if I were to read this secret dialogue, that it would merely remind me of what I already know?

Old Man:: I would like to ask whether your scholars dug up a scroll with this story, but you are the one asking me questions, and so I'll keep the goal of our conversation in mind.

If Eurydice had smuggled this dialogue into Thrace and if you could read and understood its secrets, then your soul must have known them already. We yearn for an absolute moral standard---this is because ours souls, in past lives, have already been given the Ptahhotep's secrets. It seems, then, the dialogue is only be reminding you of secret knowledge deep in your soul.

Dijon:: Perhaps you're right that the innumerable deaths of our ancestors have shaped our souls, but do you think all learning is merely remembering?

Old Man:: I do.

Dijon:: If learning is reminding our soul of what it knew from past lives, then both dialect would also be limited to reminding us.

Old Man:: That's correct.

Dijon:: Earlier, when you said writing can only remind us of what we know, you must have meant more than this. I think you meant that writing could only remind us of things we knew _in this life_.

Old Man:: You're right, that is what I meant.

Dijon:: And so, I ask again: Do you think, if I were to read this secret dialogue between our scribe and Ptahhotep, that it would merely remind me of what I already knew in this life? Keep in mind that I had the same question as our scribe. Thus, Ptahhotep's answer may as well have been spoken to me.

Old Man:: You're right. The written word, like dialectic, can sow the seeds of knowledge.

Dijon:: Where I come from, there is an abundance of written words: If you shout a question towards the heavens, Boreas, Zephyrus, Notus, and Eurus will bring you everything that's been written about the question before an oak leaf can fall to the ground. Thus, for many questions, I can rely on the written word.

Old Man:: I would travel through dense forests and over high mountains to live in such a place---you are blessed.

It sounds to me that the written word may be able to sow abundantly, having so many seeds to throw. But throwing seeds is not enough to make them grow in another's soul. One most press it into the dirt and water them.

Stranger, I take it that you, like me, have read widely and that you've observed this pattern in yourself: it's not easy to identify and seek out the seeds that could choke out the plants in your own soul. The longer the plants have been growing, the more rooted they are. Furthermore, because the author can't defend their ideas, its easy for us to dismiss them prematurely---maybe before we've really understood them.

I've conceded your point about the written word, but dialectic is still a more able farmer. It can weed out the unhealthy plants.

Dijon:: Dialectic is powerful. It seems to me like we should take a middle path. Both dialectic and the written word can sow new seeds. Both can lead to these seeds taking root if we are willing to let them.

We can surround ourselves with ideas that agree with

TODO: talk about the wide availability of books to answer many questions

TODO: talk about how dialectic forces people to face opinions they don't want to face, but that this is only true if you are conversing with the right people---people with different opinions and a willingness to disagree. If you converse with people that will just agree with you, then dialectic is no better than the written word. Allusions to twitter/present day and rhetoric.

TODO: argument:

1. if you have dialectical discussion, does the person learn? yes
2. what if you wrote down this discourse, so someone could read it---could they learn, yes but they'd have other questions
3. you could write other dialogues
4. discuss the desired to learn; need to give the author the benefit of the doubt

TODO: make comparison between Old Man and the Amon myth; Old Man "invented" the dialectic, and so he loves it more than he should

TODO: talk about the value of writing, and how writing can create new thoughts out of nothing

Dijon:: Does all spoken conversation lead us to the truth?

Old Man:: Clearly no.

Dijon:: In what ways does conversation fail to lead us to the truth?

Old Man:: When the two parties agree with one another, they may not know which questions to ask themselves to reveal their ignorance or incorrect views. TODO: replace with example from sports

Or, one person may know the truth but does want to correct the other person. TODO: a young man complaining about his father to his older lover, the lover may not want to correct the younger man for the fear of pushing the younger man away.

Dijon:: Thus, it doesn't see there is anything about conversation that is unique. Rather, it is a desire to seek the truth that matters. This desire can be found in two people conversing, as well as in a single person reading books in a library. Which approach is more likely to lead someone to the truth may depend more on how easy it is to find a smart person to talk or the appropriate book to read, rather than anything else. Where I come from, it is often easier to find the right book to read then the right person to talk to.

How can we make people want to seek the truth?

Old Man:: It is quite a difficult thing.

TODO: Add discussion about how to help people pursue the truth

1. Old Man pursued Young Man. Don't dismiss their views (e.g., Lysias) directly.

2. Show an interest in the other person.

3. Reference the Gorgias conversation
