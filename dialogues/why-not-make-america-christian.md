Dijon:: If you know Christianity is true, wouldn't you want it established by congress as the state religion?

Aaron:: No---even if _you_ know it's true, other citizens may disagree.

Dijon:: But they'd be mistaken, right? Some kooks believe the moon-landing was made up, but that doesn't mean our textbooks should equivocate on the matter.

Aaron:: Sure. There are always suspicious and uneducated people with their opinions. But religion is more important than some footprints on the moon.

Dijon:: If it's more important, wouldn't that also make it more important to establish?

Aaron:: Even if I'm certain that Christianity is true, I wouldn't want to force it on others. Good wants true believers. I couldn't prove my faith to you.

Dijon:: If you can't prove your faith to me, then how do _you_ know its true?

Aaron:: It's an internal experience---I've felt God's presence. I can't explain it with words.

Dijon:: Then it's even more important to establish Christianity as the state religion! Your privileged knowledge can save others from damnation. Certainly God wants true believers, but you wouldn't have to use a heavy hand. Don't persecute Buddhists or Muslims, just help Christians: give churches stipends for missionaries, require Bible reading in the schools, and don't let movie directors misrepresent your beliefs. You can't force someone to have faith, but you can certainly make it easier for people to believe by keeping it mainstream.

Aaron:: A moderate Christian state may be appealing, but once in power, the Christian leaders would inevitably fall into sin. They may rule beneficently for a while, but if their power was justified with religious beliefs, before long they'd persecute non-believers to preserve their power.

Dijon:: You're probably right, but it could be worthwhile if you could saved enough souls before it fell apart. Medieval Europeans didn't enjoy natural rights, but think of the gleat many peasants that were saved! Christianity has been waning since the Enlightenment gave us liberty and equality. Maybe it was a poor trade?

Aaron:: Perhaps, but Americans won't give up their religions freedom.

Dijon:: It's only a thought experiment---

Aaron:: Besides, Christianity isn't homogeneous. I know Jesus died for my sins, but I'm much less confident that infants need to be baptised.
