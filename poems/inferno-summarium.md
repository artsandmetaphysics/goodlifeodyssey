*Dark Wood*
Dante, astray in a dark wood, sees light.
Since leopard, lion, and wolf halt our ways,
wise Virgil comes to guide us past our plight.

*Dark Wood*
The pilgrim, no Aeneas or Paul, stays.
"Your Beatrice sent me, so have no fear---
our path is sure, though into hell's deep maze."

*Ante-Inferno*
"Abandon every hope, who enter here,"
declares the gate. Agnostics chase a flag,
while unrepentant throng Acheron's pier.

*Circle I: Limbo*
Sorrow without torments for those who lag
the saving cross---Homer, Plato, and so.
Castle and green uplifts though spirits sag.

*Circle II: Lust*
Shades confess, then Minos' tail casts below.
Tempests endlessly buffet the lusting.
Our pilgrim faints for false Fransesca's show.

*Circle III: Gluttonous*
Overeaters bark in the cold, falling,
foul, filfth with the three-headed demon dog.
A man foretells of the white Guelphs ending.

*Circle IV: Spendthrifts and Prodigals*
*Circle V: Wrathful and Slothful*
Hoarders and spendthrifts, in a circular slog,
roll weights to and fro. The wrathful damn'd fight
while the slothful's bubbles cover the bog.

*The Gate of Dis*
*Circle VI: The Heretics*
Furies, halting our nervous pair, incite
an angel to descend and clear the way,
where heretics, crowded in tombs, alight.

*Circle VI: The Heretics*
Proud Farinata rises to waylay
the two, as they pass buried Epicures.
Sad news, with dark prophecy, he repays.

*Circle VI: The Heretics*
Adjusting to the stench, Virgil confers
hell's order: incontinence, violence,
then fraud---with ever increasing tortures.

*Circle VII Outer Ring: Violent to Others*
Half-bull dismissed, they see a turbulent
stream of boiling blood immersing tyrants
and killers, watch'd by centaurs with bows bent.

*Circle VII Middle Ring: Violent to Self*
