*Dark Wood*
Dante, astray in a dark wood, sees light.
Since leopard, lion, and wolf halt our ways,
wise Virgil comes to guide us past our plight.

*Dark Wood*
The pilgrim, no Aeneas or Paul, stays.
"Your Beatrice sent me, so have no fear---
our path is sure, though into hell's deep maze."

*Ante-Inferno*
"Abandon every hope, who enter here,"
declares the gate. Agnostics chase a flag,
while unrepentant throng Acheron's pier.

*Circle I: Limbo*
Sorrow without torments for those who lag
the saving cross---Homer, Plato, and so.
Castle and green uplifts though spirits sag.

*Circle II: Lust*
Shades confess, then Minos' tail casts below.
Tempests endlessly buffet the lusting.
Our pilgrim faints for false Fransesca's show.

*Circle III: Gluttonous*
Overeaters bark in the cold, falling,
foul, filfth with the three-headed demon dog.
A man foretells of the white Guelphs ending.

*Circle IV: Spendthrifts and Prodigals*
*Circle V: Wrathful and Slothful*
Hoarders and spendthrifts, in a circular slog,
roll weights to and fro. The wrathful damn'd fight
while the slothful's bubbles cover the bog.

*The Gate of Dis*
*Circle VI: The Heretics*
Furies, halting our nervous pair, incite
an angel to descend and clear the way,
where heretics, crowded in tombs, alight.

*Circle VI: The Heretics*
Proud Farinata rises to waylay
the two, as they pass buried Epicures.
Sad news, with dark prophecy, he repays.

*Circle VI: The Heretics*
Adjusting to the stench, Virgil confers
hell's order: incontinence, violence,
then fraud---with ever increasing tortures.

*Circle VII Outer Ring: Violent to Others*
Half-bull dismissed, they see a turbulent
stream of boiling blood immersing tyrants
and killers, watch'd by centaurs with bows bent.

*Circle VII Middle Ring: Violent to Self*
Self-killers turn into trees, who spout grunts
and blood when snapped and someday will hang bodies.
Nude squanderers flee, the prey of dog hunts.

*Circle VII Inner Ring: Blasphemers*
A rain of fire justly rewards blasphemies
in this circle of sand, cross'd only via tears
flowing from the Old Man's diverse crevices.

*Circle VII Inner Ring: Sodomites*
Dantes' mentor, Ser Brunetto, appears---
seeking fame though blackened. He foretells his
pupils' exile, who says he'll persevere.

*Circle VII Inner Ring: More Sodomites*
Three Florentines encircle Dante: "'tis
true, courtesy and valour flew our state?"
They left saddened. Then Geryon, summoned, is.

*Circle VII Inner Ring: Usurers*
A serpent, scorpion, man---instantiate
fraud---carried them down to the eighth dark ring,
passing lenders who'd used an unfair rate.

*Circle VIII Pouch I: Panders and Seducers*
*Circle VIII Pouch II: Flatterers*
The first of ten dikes is filled with marching
pimps and seducers, whipped red. Jason's there.
Next, dipped in shit, are those damned for flatt'ring,

*Circle VIII Pouch III: Simonists*
then buried priests, flaming feet in the air,
who pimped dear Jesus' bride for gold.
Indignant Dante calls the pope's pain fair.

*Circle VIII Pouch IV: Diviners*
The mages contort their necks, and behold
there buttocks fore'er. Rejecting pity,
our guide utters a story that's scrambled.

*Circle VIII Pouch V: Barrators*
Corrupt officials boil in tar and flee
from poking demons, who'd sooner harm than
guide the two, if not for heaven holy.

*Circle VIII Pouch V: With Demons*
The escorts hook a tardy denizen
of the pit, who's questioned 'between torment,
escapes, leaving tarred captors. We're free again.

*Circle VIII Pouch VI: Hypocrites*
A sliding escape. The hypocrites, bent
by painted lead cloaks, trudge o're pharisees.
Two false fat friars direct their ascent.

*Circle VIII Pouch VII: Thieves*
After the climb, and breathing break, armies
of snakes emerge below---who bite, hand-cuff,
and somehow ignite frantic naked thieves.

*Circle VIII Pouch VII: Thieves*
One rebel's neck is squeezed shut---"enough!"
Two other's flesh and bones are stolen when,
wax-like, they meld with serpents, coiled rough.

*Circle VIII Pouch VIII: False Councselors Ulysses*

*Circle VIII Pouch VIII: False Councselors Guido*

*Circle VIII Pouch IX: Sowers of Scandal and Schism*

*Circle VIII Pouch IX: Sowers of Scandal and Schism*
*Circle VIII Pouch X: Falsifiers*
