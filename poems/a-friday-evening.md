> It's a Friday evening,  
> dinner's not yet started.  
>   
> Elanor is grinning,  
> prancing. Now she's stacking  
> wooden blocks, painted red,  
> purple, pink and yellow,  
> green and robin-egg blue.  
>   
> Some make dominoes, while  
> others we spin and roll.  
> Wobbling, wobbling, wobbling---  
> they end with a crescendo.  
>   
> "Mama", "dada", "uh-oh"---  
> little words that echo  
> through this small apartment,  
> along with pronouncements  
> only parents could decipher.  
>   
> Next we scribble on New  
> Yorkers, coloring in  
> cartoons and white corners.  
>   
> Then our one-year-old gets  
> jealous of the pen I'm  
> writing poems with. "No no."  
> Crayons scatter. Blocks bang.  
> Dinner preparations  
> begin and play time ends.
