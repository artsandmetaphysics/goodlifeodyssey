<blockquote>
<p>One of the scribes came near and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he answered them well, he asked him, “Which commandment is the first of all?” Jesus answered, “The first is, ‘Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is one; you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.’ The second is this, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.” Then the scribe said to him, “You are right, Teacher; you have truly said that ‘he is one, and besides him there is no other’; and ‘to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the strength,’ and ‘to love one’s neighbor as oneself,’—this is much more important than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.” When Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, “You are not far from the kingdom of God.” After that no one dared to ask him any question.</p>

Most Christians don’t recognize how extreme the second greatest commandment is.  We love ourselves quite a bit, so loving our neighbors as ourselves is exceedingly difficult.

Who are our neighbors?  Does it include all other humans, or only those in our immediate vicinity?  If the latter, it seems that Christian hermits are fleeing to the hills to avoid fulfilling this extremely challenging ethical imperative.

Presumably we must love our neighbor’s children as we love our own children.

The Golden Rule, as I understand it, is much more moderate:

<blockquote>
<p>“In everything do to others as you would have them do to you; for this is the law and the prophets.”</p>
<cite>— Matthew 7:12, NRSV</cite>

I would not expect a complete stranger to give their life for me in most circumstances.  If I was poor, I would not expect a wealthy person who lives on the other side of the world to give up everything they own to help me.  I may expect the wealthy person to donate *some* amount to help others, but certainly not everything.  I also would not expect my neighbor to love me as they love themselves.
