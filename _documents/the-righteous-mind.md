## Questions

What is the precise difference between moral rationalism and empiricism?

Certainly the empiricist is allowed to use reason to develop their morality? Perhaps the distinction is that the empiricist believes we merely follow the patterns set by the humans around us, while the rationalist uses first-principles to derive morality.

Rationalism and empiricism would then be gradations on a spectrum. The rationalist uses observations and experience, as well as reason.

## The Rationalist Delusion

At first Haidt seemed to agree with Hume that reason _ought_ to serve emotions.  This interpretation is strengthed by his use of the term the “rationalist delusion.”  But I think Haidt does _not_ believe reason should serve the emotions.  Instead, he is skeptical of the individual’s ability to reason, but ultimately reason is still king.

At the end of Book I, Haidt presents his most compelling arguments against the rationalist view of the mind (and moral thinking):

<blockquote>
<p>Anyone who values truth should stop worshipping reason. We all need to take a cold hard look at the evidence and see reasoning for what it is … most of the bizarre and depressing research findings make perfect sense once you see reasoning as having evolved not to help us find truth but to help us engage in arguments, persuasion, and manipulation in the context of discussions with other people … ”This explains why the confirmation bias is so powerful, and so ineradicable. How hard could it be to teach students to look on the other side, to look for evidence against their favored view? Yet, in fact, it’s very hard, and nobody has yet found a way to do it. It’s hard because the confirmation bias is a built-in feature (of an argumentative mind), not a bug that can be removed (from a platonic mind).</p>
<p>I’m not saying we should all stop reasoning and go with our gut feelings. Gut feelings are sometimes better guides than reasoning for making consumer choices and interpersonal judgments, but they are often disastrous as a basis for public policy, science, and law. Rather, what I’m saying is that we must be wary of any individual’s ability to reason. We should see each individual as being limited, like a neuron. A neuron is really good at one thing: summing up the stimulation coming into its dendrites to “decide” whether to fire a pulse along its axon. A neuron by itself isn’t very smart. But if you put neurons together in the right way you get a brain; you get an emergent system that is much smarter and more flexible than a single neuron.</p>
<p>In the same way, each individual reasoner is really good at one thing: finding evidence to support the position he or she already holds, usually for intuitive reasons. We should not expect individuals to produce good, open-minded, truth-seeking reasoning, particularly when self-interest or reputational concerns are in play. But if you put individuals together in the right way, such that some individuals can use their reasoning powers to disconfirm the claims of others, and all individuals feel some common bond or shared fate that allows them to interact civilly, you can create a group that ends up producing good reasoning as an emergent property of the social system. This is why it’s so important to have intellectual and ideological diversity within any group or institution whose goal is to find truth (such as an intelligence agency or a community of scientists) or to produce good public policy (such as a legislature or advisory board). And if our goal is to produce good behavior, not just good thinking, then it’s even more important to reject rationalism and embrace intuitionism. <cite>(pp. 104–5)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

The evidence presented in part one highlights how difficult it is for individual reasoning to find truth.  In this quote, Haidt presents his alternative method—diverse groups civilly debating one another.  This alternative method of truth-finding appeals to me; many of my most productive intellectual developments stem from conversations.

This passage implies that the individual reasoner _can_ arrive at the truth in some cases, especially when within a diverse and civil group. Afterall, the individuals must be able to accept the external arguments which are most true.  If they can’t, how could the group arrive at the truth?

Haidt anticipates this tension when he says:

<blockquote>
<p>I have tried to make a reasoned case that our moral capacities are best described from an intuitionist perspective. I do not claim to have examined the question from all sides, nor to have offered irrefutable proof. Because of the insurmountable power of the confirmation bias, counterarguments will have to be produced by those who disagree with me. Eventually, if the scientific community works as it is supposed to, the truth will emerge as a large number of flawed and limited minds battle it out. <cite>(p. 107)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

All skeptics of individual reasoning face this contradiction when they reason.

Haidt focuses on morality, politics, and psychology, fields where truth is ambiguous and our individual bias are profound.  These biases are less problematic in other fields, such as math and physics, where reality more immediatly tempers our biases.

<blockquote>
<p>I have argued that the Humean model (reason is a servant) fits the facts better than the Platonic model (reason could and should rule) or the Jeffersonian model (head and heart are co-emperors). But when Hume said that reason is the “slave” of the passions, I think he went too far … When does the elephant listen to reason? The main way that we change our minds on moral issues is by interacting with other people. We are terrible at seeking evidence that challenges our own beliefs, but other people do us this favor, just as we are quite good at finding errors in other people’s beliefs. When discussions are hostile, the odds of change are slight. The elephant leans away from the opponent, and the rider works frantically to rebut the opponent’s charges. But if there is affection, admiration, or a desire to please the other person, then the elephant leans toward that person and the rider tries to find the truth in the other person’s arguments. The elephant may not often change its direction in response to objections from its own rider, but it is easily steered by the mere presence of friendly elephants (that’s the social persuasion link in the social intuitionist model) or by good arguments given to it by the riders of those friendly elephants (that’s the reasoned persuasion link). <cite>(p. 79)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

Haidt uses “reason” to mean an individual brain’s flawed “ability to reason,” not the abstract conceptualization of reason as a pure good thing.

To see why this distinction is important, imagine a biased partisan searching for evidence to affirm their party’s position.  In one sense this individual is “reasoning”—he is using the reasoning part of his mind.  In another sense, they are only reasoning in proportion to their ability to find the truth.  (… but on further consideration, if we define “reason” to be “the path towards truth,” then it is a useless definition … I think Haidt’s definition of the term reason is actually more appropriate …)

Haidt’s skepticism towards reason is less radical that it first seems—it seems that he agrees with Plato that abstract reason _should_ be king, but that individuals are not goo

## What is Reason?

What does Haidt mean by “reason?”  To begin, lets assume he means what is normally meant.  What is normally meant by the word “reason?”

Sometimes the word is used as a noun.  For example, “my reason for moving to New York.”  Here the “reason” is the result of “reasoning.”  It is the output of a process.  “A cause, explanation, or justification for an action or event.”

The word “reason” is also used as a verb.  To “reason” is to “think, understand, and form judgments by a process of logic.”

The reasoning process varies with the task. Consider:

- Solving a mathematics problem
- Designing a physics experiment
- Modeling weather systems
- Deducing the conclusions of a psychology experiment
- Deciding whether to hire a particular individual
- Predicting the effects of law on society

It surprises me that so many varied actives are considered “reasoning.”  The processes that are followed by a mathematician and a politician are quite different.

Good reasoning tends to lead to true judgments.  But even reasoning which leads to false judgments may be “good” in the sense that the conclusions drawn were the most likely given the evidence available.

## Objects vs Relationships

Near the opening of book II, Haidt makes the following claim:

<blockquote>
<p>The WEIRDer (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic) you are, the more you see a world filled with separate objects, rather than relationships.</p>
</blockquote>

He then presents some experimental evidence to back his claim, before proceeding to draw very wide-ranging conclusions from this assessment. For example, he says:

<blockquote>
<p>But if you live in a non-WEIRD society in which people are more likely to see relationships, contexts, groups, and institutions, then you won’t be so focused on protecting individuals. You’ll have a more sociocentric morality, which means that you place the needs of groups and institutions first, often ahead of the needs of individuals.</p>
</blockquote>

Haidt’s justification for these claims is insufficient.

First he presents an experiment where Eastern Asians and Americans are asked to complete “I am …”, and WEIRD people describe themselves in terms of their own attributes, while Eastern Asian people describe themselves in terms of their relationships with others.

I suspect there _are_ significant differences between these two groups. I even accept that Eastern Asians are more likely to view themselves in terms of their relationships than Westerners (based on my experiences talking to Asian people).

But the study presented does not seem to be good evidence for the claim that Eastern Asians perceive the world differently.

Next he presents a visual experiment:

<blockquote>
<p>The differences run deep; even visual perception is affected. In what’s known as the framed-line task, you are shown a square with a line drawn inside it. You then turn the page and see an empty square that is larger or smaller than the original square. Your task is to draw a line that is the same as the line you saw on the previous page, either in absolute terms (same number of centimeters; ignore the new frame) or in relative terms (same proportion relative to the frame). Westerners, and particularly Americans, excel at the absolute task, because they saw the line as an independent object in the first place and stored it separately in memory. East Asians, in contrast, outperform Americans at the relative task, because they automatically perceived and remembered the relationship among the parts.</p>
</blockquote>

The connection between the visual experiment and these broad claims about sociocentric cultures is weak at best.

Furthermore, a research group in China [attempted to reproduce](https://doi.org/10.1167/8.12.2) the visual perception experiment, and did not see the cultural differences that Kutayama did.

<blockquote>
<p>Our data do not support the hypothesis advocated in Kitayama et al. (2003) that basic visual perception is influenced by the perceiver’s cultural background. Instead, the data could be explained by a simpler notion that a visible frame of reference helps encode more precisely a line’s length relative to the frame than the same line’s length independent of the frame (Rock &amp; Ebenholtz, 1959).</p>
</blockquote>

In general, I thought the evidence presented in Part II was much weaker than in Part I. For example, Haidt presents the “evolutionary origins” of the different taste receptors, but as best I recall, didn’t provide any evidence (beyond the fact that all his claims are plausible) for them. I appreciated that he said:

<blockquote>
<p>My goal was to find links between virtues and well-established evolutionary theories. I didn’t want to make the classic mistake of amateur evolutionary theorists, which is to pick a trait and then ask: “Can I think of a story about how this trait might once have been adaptive?” The answer to that question is almost always yes because reasoning can take you wherever you want to go. Anyone with access to an armchair can sit down and generate what Rudyard Kipling called “just-so stories”—fantastical accounts of how the camel got a hump and the elephant got a trunk. My goal, in contrast, was to identify the most obvious links between two fields I deeply respected: anthropology and evolutionary psychology.</p>
</blockquote>

I think Haidt’s overall thesis is very plausible, and I have so-far enjoyed his discussion a lot and feel that he has provided a nice mental model of morality. But his scientific justification for his thesis feels misleading.

I suspect it does, but why?
