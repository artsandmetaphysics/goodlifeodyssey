  Thoughts on Free Will

What is _will_?

I use my will, or willpower, to get out of bed, complete workouts, not overeat, maintain firm boundaries with Elanor, avoid reading the news, and to write in the evenings after work.

How does _will_ differ from _desire_?

I desire a healthy body and a clear mind, and so I workout and don’t overeat. I desire a well-behaved and happy child, and so I maintain firm boundaries. I desire increased understanding and the attention of others, and so I write and avoid wasting free time. Thus, will and desire are related.

How is will related to conciousness? Instinctual, or unconscious actions, it seems, can’t be produced by the will. Thus, will and conciousness are related.

What does it mean to have free will? Does it mean we are an un-caused cause?
