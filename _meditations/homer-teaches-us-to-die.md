This morning, while Elanor scribbled with her new box of sixteen crayons, I sifted through my new Alexander Pope translation of the _Iliad_. I read how Teuthras’ son, Tydides, killed a good man from Arisbe and his servant:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Next Teuthras’ son distain’d the sands with blood,</p>
<p>Axylus, hospitable, rich, and good:</p>
<p>In fair Arisbe’s walls (his native place)</p>
<p>He held his seat! a friend to human race.</p>
<p>Fast by the road, his ever-open door</p>
<p>Obliged the wealthy, and relieved the poor.</p>
<p>To stern Tydides now he falls a prey,</p>
<p>No friend to guard him in the dreadful day!</p>
<p>Breathless the good man fell, and by his side</p>
<p>His faithful servant, old Calesius, died.</p>
</blockquote>

I’d like to be a friend of the human race and to those passing by my life, opening my door and sharing wealth, and so I identified with Axylus. Once identified, his mortality becomes in my mortality.

When read aloud, these passages rush by. Dresus is slain, then Opheltius with his twin children, then Polypoetes, then Pidytes. You make brief connections only to let them go, like the brief pause you give an old acquaintance who’s passed away after reading the sad news online, you let sadness enter your heart and then you move on.

I know I will die. I know I’ll be fortunate to have helped a few people and to have a few deep relationships that last to the end. I know these _rationally_. The power of literature is to instill truths _emotionally_. I suspect Plato wrote dramatic dialogues, instead of treatises, in part because he understood this power, having grown up in a Homer-worshiping culture. He wanted to communicate Socrates’ love of truth to us emotionally.
