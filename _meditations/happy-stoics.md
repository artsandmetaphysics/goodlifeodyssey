“If you are distressed by something outside yourself, it is not the thing which troubles you but what you think about it, and this it is within your power to obliterate at once.” This seems like reasonable advice, but the Stoics take it to the extreme. They say we should be content even when a bear is tearing off your arm.

The stoics had other extreme beliefs: Appetite for external things—pastries or wine, love-making or music—should be abandoned because, left unfulfilled, they can cause distress. The wise stoic disdains all such appetites, focusing alone on internal reflection and reason, ends which can’t be taken. “A mind free from passions is a citadel, and man has no more secure refuge to make him safe for the future.” The stoic sage is like a man huddling in deep basement, shielded from pending plagues and air raids, cold and lonely. What is there to live for, we wonder, if you’re always down in the dark?

How could a reasonable person think such extreme beliefs? They thought we are all part of a grand univerasl nature and that everything that happens, even if it appears bad, is for the good of the whole. “Loss is nothing else than change. But the universal nature delights in change, and in obedience to her all things are now done well, and from eternity have been in like form, and will be such to time without end.”

Marcus Aurelius, in his journal, expresses doubt about this guiding divine providence. This fascinating passage shows how foundational the belief in divine order was for his many ethical imperatives. “Either a medeley of entangled and dispersed atoms, or a unity of order and Providence. If the former, why am I eager to remain in such a haphazard concatentation and confusion … the disperal of atoms will come upon me whatever I do. If the latter, however, I worship and am content and derive courage from the governing Reason.” The passage also shows how he struggled with doubts and how he lived according to a beleif system while not being entirely confident that it was true.
