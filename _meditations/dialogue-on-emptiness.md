<span class="sc">Eurus:</span> In our group discussion, you demonstrated that the concept of a bee is not fundamental; individual bees may be similar, but there is no inherent bee-essence. One may say, “bee-essence is the ability to reproduce bees.” However, you showed how gradual evolutionary change refutes this argument. “Consider an ancient bee that, if alive, could reproduce with a modern bee. Now consider an even more ancient bee that can reproduce with the ancient bee but not with the modern bee. Does the ancient bee have two essences, one to reproduce with the modern bee and another to reproduce with the more ancient bee?”

Your conceptual deconstructions remind me of śūnyatā, a tenet of the Madhyamaka Buddhist tradition. Śūnyatā says that _nothing_ has svabhāva—essence, inherent existence, or true identity.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> Thanks for sharing. I’d like to learn more about śūnyatā because it seems to me that there must be some fundamental things, perhaps particles, that inherently exist. If this weren’t the case, then how could anything exist? Said another way, although I think our minds project the _concept of a bee_ onto an external reality, I still think there are aggregates of fundamentally existing things which we call bees.

<span class="sc">Eurus:</span> Before I continue, I should point out that I’m not especially well-acquainted with Madhyamaka thought, so my comments may not be precisely correct.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> I appreciate that you are willing to engage with me on these important question, even if you aren’t entirely sure of your own beliefs. Please continue!

<span class="sc">Eurus:</span> Śūnyatā doesn’t say that nothing exists, but only that nothing has svabhāva—essence, inherent existence, or true identity. Śūnyatā is closely related to dependent origination, or pratītyasamutpāda. According to this doctrine, all phenomena arise in dependence upon other phenomena, which themselves arise in dependence upon other phenomena. Dependent origination leads to śūnyatā because phenomena can’t exist independently. Things do exist _conventionally_, similar to how Theseus’s ship exists conventionally. The error is to think that anything exists in-and-of-itself.

Nāgārjuna, who founded the Madhyamaka Buddhist school, summarizes this in a famous verse of his  _Mūlamadhyamakakārikā_:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Whatever is dependently co-arisen</p>
<p>That is explained to be emptiness.</p>
<p>That, being a dependent designation</p>
<p>Is itself the middle way.</p>
<br>
<p>Something that is not dependently arisen,</p>
<p>Such a thing does not exist.</p>
<p>Therefore a nonempty thing</p>
<p>Does not exist.</p>
</blockquote>

You say that particles exist in-and-of-themselves. While we can come up with a scientific theory with objects like particles or wave functions at the bottom, I do not believe that science itself supposes these objects have svabhāva. This would be true even if we found the correct theory of everything. It would seem highly tenuous to claim that wave functions inherently exist. To the physicist, a wave function is a mathematical tool that describes our observations. To say more is to go beyond what empirical science can support.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> I think I’m using the term _fundamentally exist_ differently than you’re using _svabhāva_. When I say something fundamentally exists, I mean it influences reality and it can’t be broken into smaller pieces. Accordingly, if a wave function completely describes the behaviors we observe and can’t be replaced by a simpler construct, then I would say it fundamentally exists.

<span class="sc">Eurus:</span> Our discussion reminds me of a passage in _The Feynman Lectures_ about the philosophical implications of quantum mechanics. I’ll read it:

<blockquote>
<p>Another thing that people have emphasized since quantum mechanics was developed is the idea that we should not speak about those things which we cannot measure. Unless a thing can be defined by measurement, it has no place in a theory. And since an accurate value of the momentum of a localized particle cannot be defined by measurement it therefore has no place in the theory.</p>
<p>The idea that this is what was the matter with classical theory is a false position. It is a careless analysis of the situation. Just because we cannot measure position and momentum precisely does not a priori mean that we cannot talk about them. It only means that we need not talk about them. The situation in the sciences is this: A concept or an idea which cannot be measured or cannot be referred directly to experiment may or may not be useful. It need not exist in a theory. In other words, suppose we compare the classical theory of the world with the quantum theory of the world, and suppose that it is true experimentally that we can measure position and momentum only imprecisely. The question is whether the ideas of the exact position of a particle and the exact momentum of a particle are valid or not. The classical theory admits the ideas; the quantum theory does not. This does not in itself mean that classical physics is wrong.</p>
<p>When the new quantum mechanics was discovered, the classical people—which included everybody except Heisenberg, Schrödinger, and Born—said: “Look, your theory is not any good because you cannot answer certain questions like: what is the exact position of a particle?, which hole does it go through?, and some others.” Heisenberg’s answer was: “I do not need to answer such questions because you cannot ask such a question experimentally.” It is that we do not have to. Consider two theories (a) and (b); (a) contains an idea that cannot be checked directly but which is used in the analysis, and the other, (b), does not contain the idea. If they disagree in their predictions, one could not claim that (b) is false because it cannot explain this idea that is in (a), because that idea is one of the things that cannot be checked directly.</p>
<p>It is always good to know which ideas cannot be checked directly, but it is not necessary to remove them all. It is not true that we can pursue science completely by using only those concepts which are directly subject to experiment.</p>
</blockquote>

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> This passage is very relevant. I had said something fundamentally exists if “it influences reality and it can’t be broken into smaller pieces.” But what does it mean to say something “influences reality” or that something “can’t be broken into smaller pieces”? We can improve this definition using the ideas in this passage. How about something fundamentally exists if it is an irreducible concept in a theory that explains all our empirical observations?

<span class="sc">Eurus:</span> Your second definition is better, but it still feels odd to me. There are several mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics. Can constructs that aren’t directly measured and which can be removed in another formulation said to fundamentally exist? They seem more like mathematical machinery to me.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> Such constructs do _feel_ like mathematical machinery. However, if the materialists are correct, how could it be any other way? If the fundamental building blocks of reality, say atoms, are small and simple and eyes are large and complex, then eyes would necessarily not be able to see the atoms. Atoms could only be known indirectly. Furthermore, if the universe is ordered, the atoms would follow mathematical laws and thus would be indirectly-known mathematical machinery.

I can imagine a dualistic universe where sight is a fundamental property of mind. Since sight isn’t be constructed from atoms, the minds could possibly see material atoms directly. It would be as if our vision was pixelated, and the laws of physics appeared to operate on pixels. Minds could wonder if the pixels had underlying objects.

In all cases, there may be some underlying object or mechanism below the fundamentally existing things—or there may not. How could we know?

The physicist studying the laws of nature is like the programmer reverse-engineering a software libraries’ interface without access to the implementation. If the implementation acts in a consistent way, then with enough effort, we may be able to perfectly understand and describe the interface. We could predict how it would work in future situations. However, we would have no way of knowing anything about the software library besides its observable behavior. We could hypothesize about how it is implemented—what the particles are in-and-of-themselves—but we would have no way of validating the hypotheses.

Therefore, I agree empirical science can’t say anything about underlying objects, divorced from empirical science. However, if to have svabhāva means something different than to fundamentally exist, then by definition, it is a property of the unknowable underlying objects.

This doesn’t mean svabhāva is a meaningless term. If we spoke about the sensation of blue to a citizen of a blueless universe, they wouldn’t know what we mean—but that doesn’t mean blue isn’t a valid concept. But it does mean we would require divine revelation to know whether anything has svabhāva. In our software analogy, divine revelation is like the library’s author telling us unobservable implementation details.

<span class="sc">Eurus:</span> You make some interesting points. You’ve defined to _fundamentally exist_ to ensure it empirical science can verify it. I agree, according to this definition, wave functions fundamentally exist. I don’t think wave functions have svabhāva.

How is svabhāva different than your term _fundamentally exist_? Ordinary beings perceive phenomena as ultimately real entities, existing by themselves, having svabhāva. Awakened beings perceive them as they truly are: illusory, dreamlike, and conceptually constructed. The projection of svabhāva onto phenomena is a manifestation of avidyā, which awakened beings no longer possess. This is the sense in which svabhāva is most relevant for salvation because liberation is only achieved by uprooting avidyā, not just by _knowing about_ avidyā. A common analogy is that Buddhist teachings are like a finger pointing at the moon. Metaphorical language—such as calling phenomena “illusory”—therefore serves a pragmatic purpose. However, it can still be useful to make more precise intellectual arguments because this can cause one to relinquish false views about reality, paving the way for new understanding to arise.

What can then be said about svabhāva from a more precise, metaphysical perspective? Nāgārjuna says at the beginning of chapter 15 of the _Mūlamadhyamakakārikā_:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Svabhāva cannot reasonably occur</p>
<p>Due to causes and conditions.</p>
<p>Svabhāva that arises due to causes and conditions</p>
<p>Would be svabhāva that is produced.</p>
<br>
<p>“Svabhāva that is produced,”</p>
<p>How could that be right?</p>
<p>Svabhāva is not fabricated</p>
<p>And does not depend on anything else.</p>
</blockquote>

If you analyze the notion of a chair, the chair disappears and you are left with wooden parts. The chair is not an ultimately real entity; it doesn’t possess svabhāva. You, of course, know this, since our conversation began with a similar deconstruction of the notion of a species, but this is only one type of existential dependence.

The dGe-Lugs tradition identifies three types of existential dependence: dependence on causes and conditions, dependence on parts, and dependence on the designating mind. These exist within a hierarchy, with dependence on the designating mind being the most subtle and incorporating all three.

Svabhāva is thus a stronger notion than your term _fundamentally exist_, which permits dependence on causes and conditions.

For example, a wave function is different at every point in time. Therefore the idea of the wave function as a single entity that changes over time can be decomposed into a sequence of wave function snapshots in succession, similar to how we decompose a chair into its parts. This means that we have an entity—the wave function at an instant—which is supposed to exist inherently and be the cause of another wave function—the wave function at the next instant.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> If a wave function snapshot fully determines the next snapshot, then it seems the _essence_ of the wavefunction is present in the first snapshot.

<span class="sc">Eureus:</span> This could be true for a simple idealized wave function, but any real wave function will depend on changing boundary conditions. For example, a quantum harmonic oscillator may evolve deterministically, but what maintains the quadratic potential? Unless the entire universe was just a harmonic oscillator, it _would_ change eventually, and when it does there would be existential dependence; you would no longer be able to predict the wave function’s future state from it’s current state, and there would be no essence.

The division between a system and its surroundings is a useful approximation, but you can’t splice the world like this. This is true even in classical mechanics, but in quantum mechanics, entanglement even more strongly prohibits the division, since two particles that are far apart can affect one another. David Bohm describes this nicely in one of his papers:

<blockquote>
<p>A quantum many-body system cannot properly be analyzed into independently existent parts, with fixed and determinate dynamical relationships between each of the parts. Rather, the “parts” are seen to be in an immediate connection, in which their dynamical relationships depend, in an irreducible way, on the state of the whole system (and indeed on that of broader systems in which they are contained, extending ultimately and in principle to the entire universe). Thus, one is led to a new notion of unbroken wholeness which denies the classical idea of analyzability of the world into separately and independently existent parts.</p>
</blockquote>

As I’m sure you know, Bohm’s interpretation of quantum mechanics is one of a few. However, I think this point is valid in all interpretations.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> I think you’re correct. Let me read a quote from Sean Carroll:

<blockquote>
<p>A feature that is common to all interpretations of quantum mechanics is that what we see when we look at the world is quite different from how we describe the world when we’re not looking at it. In a sense it is the ultimate unification: not only does the deepest layer of reality not consist of things like “oceans” and “mountains”; it doesn’t even consist of things like “electrons” and “photons.” It’s just the quantum wave function. Everything else is a convenient way of talking.</p>
</blockquote>

Therefore, I was mistaken when I said “perhaps particles” are the fundamentally existing building blocks of reality. Electrons, like bees, are a conceptual projection onto the universe’s wave function.

In another place, Carroll says the wave function may evolve deterministically. If this is the case, then would you say that the wave function of the universe has svabhāva?

<span class="sc">Eurus:</span> If the universe was _only_ a single deterministic wave function, I think it would _fundamentally exist_ and have _svabhāva_. But I disagree with the premise. It’s unfathomable to me that conciousness and volition could be produced in such a universe. Therefore, I think the non-deterministic interpretations of quantum mechanics are correct. After all, they are all interpretations; no objective evidence can be used to distinguish them.

We’ve been discussing śūnyatā from a metaphysical perspective and exploring how it relates to physics. But I suspect any connection between śūnyatā and modern physics is coincidental. It is not a metaphysical proposition about the existence or nonexistence of a reality outside of the mind. It is not an idea that makes measurable predictions, therefore it isn’t falsifiable in the ordinary sense.

The full implications of śūnyatā go beyond providing a theoretical understanding of the physical universe. Śūnyatā is an insight into the nature of the mind—the very reality that’s right in front of us. As such, it is something that can be _directly known_. It is only verifiable via a direct perception of emptiness, and that only occurs with the first bhūmi—the first spiritual attainment of the bodhisattva path. It takes considerable effort to achieve this, though, so there has to be some faith involved in the beginning.

In this sense, I don’t believe that śūnyatā can be known without some kind of _revelation_. Although not a _divine revelation_, as you said earlier, since that implies it can only be known through an omniscient being telling us. That alone isn’t an adequate means of knowledge, because then how do you know that the being is omniscient and truthful? So divine revelation seems like a euphemism for unknowable. In a way, there is some divine revelation at play here—the Buddha is an omniscient being—but the important difference, as stated above, is that confirmation is possible via direct perception.

If emptiness seems difficult to pin down, you’re in good company—I don’t think the idea can ever be fully grasped without realization. After all, its realization demarcates bodhisattvas from ordinary beings. Given this, I think that it would be prudent to give the idea space to evolve and to withhold judgment somewhat. There is a Zen metaphor about this, which I’ll read:

<blockquote>
<p>Nan-in, a Japanese master during the Meiji era, received a university professor who came to inquire about Zen.</p>
<p>Nan-in served tea. He poured his visitor’s cup full, and then kept on pouring.</p>
<p>The professor watched the overflow until he no longer could restrain himself. “It is overfull. No more will go in!”</p>
<p>“Like this cup,” Nan-in said, “you are full of your own opinions and speculations. How can I show you Zen unless you first empty your cup?”</p>
</blockquote>

Not that you’re tea cup is full, but it can be helpful to have this in mind when approaching a new set of ideas. And, of course, it is perfectly valid to go back and compare or critique after having first considered the new ideas on their own terms.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> My cup is partially filled with a materialist world view, but I will try to empty it. I’ve often pondered how consciousness could arise from matter. Despite this, I’ve always viewed the mind, our brain, and our senses as a small object in a vast external world. I’ve never seriously considered whether the mind could be primary and the external world secondary.

If the mind were primary, then I could imagine how one could know that nothing has svabhāva, even if this weren’t apparent in the laws of physics.

I have to go, but perhaps when we resume our conversation we can explore why you think the mind is primary?

<span class="sc">Eurus:</span> That sounds good. I look forward to it.

In general, I think that emptiness is difficult to understand. And I don’t feel like I really understand it. But I think that this is a byproduct of the fact that it’s meant to point at ultimate reality, which is incomprehensible to deluded beings. I know this is not a very satisfactory answer, but I’m not sure I understand well enough to answer confidently what the dream analogy points to, other than to say that it points to the fact that our minds cognize phenomena as discrete, inherently existing entities, whereas those divisions do not really exist from their own side, and therefore this discriminating awareness that we possess is not in accord with the actual nature of things. Perhaps the point of the dream analogy is to emphasize that the error is perceptual and not merely analytical.
Also, it can be useful to get different perspectives. Yogācāra (part of the third turning) has the idea of “The Three Natures,” which is a slightly different understanding of śūnyatā. Here is the Wikipedia section on this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogachara#The_Three_Natures_and_Emptiness (although this is also something that would require more in-depth study to get a proper feel for).

following aFor the sake of the argument, I’d agree that

Yes, and no. Buddhist philosophy maintains that everything depends on other things, but it doesn’t follow that everything is the “same thing.” The point is that everything is not a “thing” at all. Thus, while conventionally we say that things arise and cease in dependence upon other things, ultimately we say that things are non-arisen [anutpāda].
Let’s set aside, for the moment, the question of whether a reality exists outside of the mind. As I mentioned earlier, this question is probably unanswerable. The mind is what we have access to, so there is a chance that we can understand the metaphysical implementation details underpinning the mind, which is the only reality we know.
It may be illuminating to bring in Yogācāra, because it describes the actual process of realization whereby ignorance [avidyā] is overturned. In Yogācāra, it’s explained that the mind projects appearances which are misapprehended as truly existent external objects and contrasted with a truly existent internal self. This dualistic mode of cognition whereby the “grasper” [grāhaka] and the “grasped” [grāhya] are differentiated and reified is our ordinary consciousness [vijñāna]. Once this consciousness [vijñāna] is purified of the fundamental ignorance [avidyā] regarding the nature of phenomena, it is transformed into gnosis or enlightened cognition [jñāna], which correctly sees all phenomena as empty.

The way I understand it, the question is whether the wave function has a referent “in reality,” or if it only exists as a mental construct. Now, you made the point that this ontological distinction doesn’t make any difference in terms of the theory’s predictions and therefore it is meaningless, or at least undecidable. I agree that it is a meaningless distinction for physics. However, I do not think that it is necessarily meaningless or undecidable within the context of the Buddhadharma. It is undeniable that objects appear to us as if they exist substantially, “out there.” Therefore, to say that this is a deception is not without any experiential basis. You said:

<blockquote>
<p>I only think the concept/theory/idea of svabhāva would require divine revelation if it purports metaphysical/ontological details which also do not make any measurable predictions. Thus if it has other meanings related to cognition, I certainly don’t mean to say these could not be discovered without divine revelation.</p>
</blockquote>

I agree that in order for something to have any meaning, it seems like it has to be based in experience somehow, whether that be measurement or cognition. So I agree that if svabhāva merely purported metaphysical details without any reference to experience, it would be effectively meaningless and/or undecidable. But it does refer to something experiential: namely, the illusion that entities inherently exist. For Nāgārjuna, the point is precisely to dispel avidyā (which produces the illusion of svabhāva), yet his approach is philosophical analysis. So while I am sympathetic to this concern, and it remains to be seen whether Nāgārjuna’s arguments actually work in the way they are intended, it is at least clear that Nāgārjuna does not consider himself to be merely expounding a metaphysical theory which has no experiential counterpart, since śūnyatā can be realized.

TODO: comparison to the soul in Christianity

TODO: agree that svabhāva does matter for Buddhdharma, assuming you believe that Buddhadharma exists. For someone outside of Buddhism, looking in, you are asking yourself whether you believe any of it, and the fact that svabhāva makes sense is part of the “consistency check” you are doing. Segue into the question of “how do you know svabhāva doesn’t exist”, continue the discussion about it being a metaphysical implementation detail

then segue into the idealism discussion

---

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> To help me understand, could you give me example of something that would have svabhāva? If nothing in our universe has svabhāva, presumably the example would have to be a thought experiment—perhaps a universe that had an entity with svabhāva.

If it isn’t possible to provide such an example, I’m not sure how _svabhāva_ could be meaningful. If someone said “nothing in the universe produces the sensation of the color blue,” we would understand because we are acquainted with the color blue. But if there were no blue things, _blue_ would be meaningless.

This analogy only applies if svabhāva is itself fundamental in some way, like the sensation of the color blue is. For example, you could say “no particle in the universe has a mass of 1.2 a.u.” and you could understand what is meant even if it’s true. However, this only works because you are familiar with _mass_ and _1.2_. It doesn’t seem like _blue_ can be split up like this. Do you think svabhāva is more like the sensation of the color blue or the property of having a mass of 1.2 a.u.?
