<span class="sc">Eurus:</span> In our group discussion, you demonstrated that the concept of a species is a projection onto reality; individual bees may be similar, but there is no inherent bee-essence. This got me thinking about śūnyatā, a tenet of the Madhyamaka Buddhist tradition, which says that _nothing_ has any essence, inherent existence, or true identity. Since all phenomena are dependently originated—meaning that all things arise, or appear to arise, from causes and conditions—the world that we navigate through is an illusion, and the underlying reality is śūnyatā. This philosophy therefore rejects materialism. I thought you might enjoy the connection.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> Hey Eurus, thanks for sharing. I would like to learn more about śūnyatā, because it seems to me that there are things that do fundamentally existence—perhaps particles. My conceptual deconstruction and śūnyatā are similar in that they both deny the existence of something most people believe in, but I don’t see how _nothing_ could inherently exist.

<span class="sc">Eurus:</span> Śūnyatā doesn’t mean things are nonexistent, but only that they lack svabhāva—essence, inherent existence, or true identity. They would say that things exist conventionally, similar to how Theseus’s ship exists conventionally. The error is thinking that anything exists in-and-of-itself.

Śūnyatā is closely related to dependent origination, or pratītyasamutpāda. According to this doctine, all phenomena, or dharmas, arise in dependence upon other phenomena, which themselves are dependently originated. Dependent origination leads to śūnyatā—because phenomena only arise and persist when supported by other causes and conditions, therefore said phenomena cannot exist in and of themselves.

Nāgārjuna, who founded the Madhyamaka Buddhist school, summarizes this in a famous verse of his  _Mūlamadhyamakakārikā_:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Whatever is dependently co-arisen</p>
<p>That is explained to be emptiness.</p>
<p>That, being a dependent designation</p>
<p>Is itself the middle way.</p>
<br>
<p>Something that is not dependently arisen,</p>
<p>Such a thing does not exist.</p>
<p>Therefore a nonempty thing</p>
<p>Does not exist.</p>
</blockquote>

You say that particles exist in-and-of-themselves. While we can come up with an ontology with objects like particles, or wave functions, at the bottom, I do not believe that science itself supposes these objects have svabhāva. This would be true even if we found a correct grand unified theory. It would seem highly tenuous to claim that wave functions fundamentally exist. To the physicist, a wave function is a mathematical tool that describes our observations. To say more is to go beyond what empirical science can support.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> I think I’m using _fundamentally exist_ differently than you are using _svabhāva_. When I say something fundamentally exists, I mean it influences reality and it can’t be broken into smaller pieces.  According to this definition, if a wave function completely describes the behaviors we observe, and it can’t be replaced by a simpler construct, then it fundamentally exists. There may be some underlying mechanism or there may not. We have no way of knowing.

It’s like reverse engineering a software libraries’ interface without access to the implementation. With enough effort we may perfectly understand and describe the interface. We can hypothesize about how it is implemented, but we have no way of knowing anything beyond the observed behavior.

I’m probably saying the same thing you did when you said any statement about the existence of fundamental objects is a philosophical interpretation, divorced from empirical science. However, I fail to see how svabhāva be meaningful if it can’t be applied to wave functions—it seems like the term, by definition, can only apply to things which can’t be observed.

It’s like trying to talk about the sensation of blue in a blueless universe; although someone in a blueless universe could not know about blueness, that doesn’t mean it’s an invalid term to us. Likewise, svabhāva may be a metaphysically valid, but if it doesn’t apply to wave functions, it seems like we would have no way of knowing, apart from divine revelation. Divine revelation is like the software library’s author telling us implementation details.

I don’t get the feeling you think svabhāva is a metaphysical implementation detail, which leads me to think I am not understanding what you mean by the term.

<span class="sc">Eurus:</span> This discussion reminds me of a passage in _The Feynman Lectures_, in chapter 2 of volume III:

<blockquote>
<p>Another thing that people have emphasized since quantum mechanics was developed is the idea that we should not speak about those things which we cannot measure. (Actually relativity theory also said this.) Unless a thing can be defined by measurement, it has no place in a theory. And since an accurate value of the momentum of a localized particle cannot be defined by measurement it therefore has no place in the theory.</p>
<p>The idea that this is what was the matter with classical theory is a false position. It is a careless analysis of the situation. Just because we cannot measure position and momentum precisely does not a priori mean that we cannot talk about them. It only means that we need not talk about them. The situation in the sciences is this: A concept or an idea which cannot be measured or cannot be referred directly to experiment may or may not be useful. It need not exist in a theory. In other words, suppose we compare the classical theory of the world with the quantum theory of the world, and suppose that it is true experimentally that we can measure position and momentum only imprecisely. The question is whether the ideas of the exact position of a particle and the exact momentum of a particle are valid or not. The classical theory admits the ideas; the quantum theory does not. This does not in itself mean that classical physics is wrong.</p>
<p>When the new quantum mechanics was discovered, the classical people—which included everybody except Heisenberg, Schrödinger, and Born—said: “Look, your theory is not any good because you cannot answer certain questions like: what is the exact position of a particle?, which hole does it go through?, and some others.” Heisenberg’s answer was: “I do not need to answer such questions because you cannot ask such a question experimentally.” It is that we do not have to. Consider two theories (a) and (b); (a) contains an idea that cannot be checked directly but which is used in the analysis, and the other, (b), does not contain the idea. If they disagree in their predictions, one could not claim that (b) is false because it cannot explain this idea that is in (a), because that idea is one of the things that cannot be checked directly.</p>
<p>It is always good to know which ideas cannot be checked directly, but it is not necessary to remove them all. It is not true that we can pursue science completely by using only those concepts which are directly subject to experiment.</p>
</blockquote>

The passage prompts one to wonder: can constructs that aren’t directly measured, but are irreducible components in an accurate theory, be said to fundamentally exist? They seem more like mathematical machinery to me, rather than objects that are truly exist.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> Such constructs do _feel_ like mathematical machinery. However, if the materialist are correct, how could it be any other way? If the fundamental building blocks of reality, say atoms, are small and simple and eyes are large and complex, then eyes would necessarily not be able to see the atoms. Atoms could only be known indirectly. Furthermore, if the universe is ordered, the atoms would follow mathematical laws and thus would be indirectly known mathematical constructs.

One can imagine a dualistic universe where sight is a fundamental property of mind. Furthermore, you could imagine the minds seeing material atoms directly, since their sense of sight wouldn’t be constructed from them. It would be as if our vision was pixelated, and no matter what we did, we could not see more detail than the pixels. Furthermore, the laws of physics appeared to operate on the pixels. Even in such a universe, the beings could wonder if the pixels have underlying objects.

<span class="sc">Eurus:</span> You make a good point, but even so, I don’t think wave functions have svabhāva.

Before I continue, I should point out that I’m not well-acquainted with Madhyamaka thought, so my comments may be mistaken in some places.

Okay, so how is svabhāva different than to _fundamentally exist_? Ordinary beings perceive phenomena as ultimately real entities, existing by themselves, having svabhāva. Awakened beings perceive them as they truly are: illusory, dreamlike, and conceptually constructed. The projection of svabhāva onto phenomena is a manifestation of avidyā, which awakened beings no longer possess. This is the sense in which svabhāva is most relevant for salvation, because liberation is only achieved by uprooting avidyā, not just by _knowing about_ avidyā. A common analogy is that Buddhist teachings are like a finger pointing at the moon. Metaphorical language—such as calling phenomena “illusory”—therefore serves a pragmatic purpose. However, it can still be useful to make more precise intellectual arguments, because this can cause one to relinquish false views about reality, paving the way for new understanding to arise.

What can then be said about svabhāva from a more precise, ontological perspective? Nāgārjuna says at the beginning of chapter 15 of the _Mūlamadhyamakakārikā_:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p>Svabhāva cannot reasonably occur</p>
<p>Due to causes and conditions.</p>
<p>Svabhāva that arises due to causes and conditions</p>
<p>Would be svabhāva that is produced.</p>
<br>
<p>“Svabhāva that is produced,”</p>
<p>How could that be right?</p>
<p>Svabhāva is not fabricated</p>
<p>And does not depend on anything else.</p>
</blockquote>

If you analyze the notion of a chair, the chair disappears and you are left with wooden parts. The chair is not an ultimately real entity; it doesn’t possess svabhāva. You, of course, know this, since our conversation began with a similar deconstruction of the notion of a species, but this is only one type of existential dependence.

The dGe-Lugs commentarial tradition identifies three types of existential dependence: dependence on causes and conditions, dependence on parts, and dependence on the designating mind. These exist within a hierarchy, with conceptual dependence being the most subtle and incorporating all three.

Svabhāva is thus a stronger notion than your term _fundamentally exist_, which permits dependence on causes and conditions.

For example, a wave function is different at every point in time. Therefore the idea of the wave function as a single entity that changes over time can be decomposed into a sequence of wave function snapshots in succession, similar to how we decompose a chair into its parts. This means that we have an entity—the wave function at an instant—which is supposed to exist inherently and be the cause of another wave function—the wave function at the next instant.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> If a wave function snapshot fully determines the next snapshot, then it seems the _essence_ of the wavefunction is present in the first snapshot.

<span class="sc">Eureus:</span> This could be true for a simple idealized wave function, but any real wave function will depend on changing boundary conditions. For example, a quantum harmonic oscillator may evolve deterministically, but what maintains the quadratic potential? Unless the entire universe was just a harmonic oscillator, it _would_ change eventually, and when it does there would be existential dependence; you would no longer be able to predict the wave function’s future state from it’s current state, and there would be no essence.

To division between a system and its surroundings is a useful approximation, but you can’t splice the world like this. This is true even in classical mechanics, but in quantum mechanics, entangelement even more strongly prevents this, since there can be dependencies that span large differences. Here is a quote from David Bohm:

<blockquote>
<p>A quantum many-body system cannot properly be analyzed into independently existent parts, with fixed and determinate dynamical relationships between each of the parts. Rather, the “parts” are seen to be in an immediate connection, in which their dynamical relationships depend, in an irreducible way, on the state of the whole system (and indeed on that of broader systems in which they are contained, extending ultimately and in principle to the entire universe). Thus, one is led to a new notion of unbroken wholeness which denies the classical idea of analyzability of the world into separately and independently existent parts.</p>
</blockquote>

As I’m sure you know, Bohm’s interpretation of quantum mechanics is one of a few. However, I think this point is valid in all interpretations.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> I think you’re correct. Here is a quote from Sean Carroll:

<blockquote>
<p>A feature that is common to all interpretations of quantum mechanics is that what we see when we look at the world is quite different from how we describe the world when we’re not looking at it. In a sense it is the ultimate unification: not only does the deepest layer of reality not consist of things like “oceans” and “mountains”; it doesn’t even consist of things like “electrons” and “photons.” It’s just the quantum wave function. Everything else is a convenient way of talking.</p>
</blockquote>

Therefore, I was mistaken when I said “perhaps particles” are the fundamentally existing building blocks of reality. Electrons are like the bees, a conceptual projection onto the universe’s wave function.

In another place, Carroll says the wave function may evolve deterministically. If this is the case, then knowing the state of the universe’s wave function at one point in time would allow you to predict it at all other points. Thus, it would seem there is a permanent essence to the wave function. Would you say that the wave function of the universe has svabhāva?

TODO: discuss the situation where the laws of physics are themselves fixed and permanent, even if they aren’t deterministic

TODO: discuss whether there is an “illusion” perse then, if different species can arrive at the same laws of physics

TODO: discuss the implications of all of this

---

The way I understand it, the question is whether the wave function has a referent “in reality,” or if it only exists as a mental construct. Now, you made the point that this ontological distinction doesn’t make any difference in terms of the theory’s predictions and therefore it is meaningless, or at least undecidable. I agree that it is a meaningless distinction for physics. However, I do not think that it is necessarily meaningless or undecidable within the context of the Buddhadharma. It is undeniable that objects appear to us as if they exist substantially, “out there.” Therefore, to say that this is a deception is not without any experiential basis. You said:

<blockquote>
<p>I only think the concept/theory/idea of svabhāva would require divine revelation if it purports metaphysical/ontological details which also do not make any measurable predictions. Thus if it has other meanings related to cognition, I certainly don’t mean to say these could not be discovered without divine revelation.</p>
</blockquote>

I agree that in order for something to have any meaning, it seems like it has to be based in experience somehow, whether that be measurement or cognition. So I agree that if svabhāva merely purported metaphysical details without any reference to experience, it would be effectively meaningless and/or undecidable. But it does refer to something experiential: namely, the illusion that entities inherently exist. For Nāgārjuna, the point is precisely to dispel avidyā (which produces the illusion of svabhāva), yet his approach is philosophical analysis. So while I am sympathetic to this concern, and it remains to be seen whether Nāgārjuna’s arguments actually work in the way they are intended, it is at least clear that Nāgārjuna does not consider himself to be merely expounding a metaphysical theory which has no experiential counterpart, since śūnyatā can be realized.

TODO: comparison to the soul in Christianity

TODO: agree that svabhāva does matter for Buddhdharma, assuming you believe that Buddhadharma exists. For someone outside of Buddhism, looking in, you are asking yourself whether you believe any of it, and the fact that svabhāva makes sense is part of the “consistency check” you are doing. Segue into the question of “how do you know svabhāva doesn’t exist”, continue the discussion about it being a metaphysical implementation detail

then segue into the idealism discussion

---

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> To help me understand, could you give me example of something that would have svabhāva? If nothing in our universe has svabhāva, presumably the example would have to be a thought experiment—perhaps a universe that had an entity with svabhāva.

If it isn’t possible to provide such an example, I’m not sure how _svabhāva_ could be meaningful. If someone said “nothing in the universe produces the sensation of the color blue,” we would understand because we are acquainted with the color blue. But if there were no blue things, _blue_ would be meaningless.

This analogy only applies if svabhāva is itself fundamental in some way, like the sensation of the color blue is. For example, you could say “no particle in the universe has a mass of 1.2 a.u.” and you could understand what is meant even if it’s true. However, this only works because you are familiar with _mass_ and _1.2_. It doesn’t seem like _blue_ can be split up like this. Do you think svabhāva is more like the sensation of the color blue or the property of having a mass of 1.2 a.u.?
