  A dialogue exploring the nature of eternal life.

<span class="sc">Eagle:</span> Eternal life without God would be hell.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> Really? You love feasting with friends, wine, and stories—what some say is the best that life can offer. Wouldn’t you want to feast forever?

<span class="sc">Eagle:</span> Of course not. Feasting would grow tiresome.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> What if feasting were replaced with a more varied activity, say reliving the lives of historical people. Be Cleopatra and Napoleon. What then?

<span class="sc">Eagle:</span> However exciting Cleopatra’s life was, experiencing it over and over will also become tiresome. Endless repetition is oppressive.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> One couldn’t experience all possible lives even in eternity. One, two, three, the natural numbers are infinite, yet they can all be mapped to real numbers between one and two. There are orders of infinity. New lives are created faster than you can relive them; you need not be Cleopatra more than once.

<span class="sc">Eagle:</span> You make a valid point, but even my first earthly life excites me less than it once did. These endless reincarnations would soon become variations on a theme of tediousness.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> So you crave not only newness but also new types of newness. I’m not so particular. While I agree that parts of life are tiresome, I can imagine being eternally content. My morning coffee is always wonderful.

<span class="sc">Eagle:</span> You say that, but will you feel that way after a trillion such mornings?

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> Singing in church forever or drinking the same morning cup of coffee forever would be awful, but I think this vision of heaven is overly simplistic. I’ll try to illustrate this with an example: Why do you read the _Lord of the Rings_ every couple of years?

<span class="sc">Eagle:</span> I enjoy imagining the scenes, the words are beautiful, and Tolkien filled his story with Christian analogs.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> Are there ever passages you hadn’t noticed before?

<span class="sc">Eagle:</span> Occasionally, but it’s more common for a passage to provoke new thoughts than for me to not have noticed it.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> I see, but _Lord of the Rings_ is your favorite story—you’ve read it often than any other.

<span class="sc">Eagle:</span> Yes.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> Are there any books you read when you were young that you’ve entirely forgotten?

<span class="sc">Eagle:</span> There are a few… I may have a few vague recollections if I reread them, but that’s all.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> So I think our minds forget fast enough that eternity could remain enjoyable. Since our mind is finite, we would quickly forget the distant past, and therefore wouldn’t feel oppressed by it.

<span class="sc">Eagle:</span> Perhaps, but if the distant past is completely forgotten, you may as well be a different person!

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> That’s true if memory is the essence of personal identity, but if character is the essence of identity, we side-step the problem.

<span class="sc">Eagle:</span> It’s an unsatisfying solution—if the past is completely forgotten, it must be meaningless. What would be the purpose of it all?

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> To enjoy the coffee.

<span class="sc">Eagle:</span> You’re being facetious. Enjoyment, even a sophisticated sort, isn’t a good purpose.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> If heaven could be improved, it would have been. It seems any purpose would have to be a sort of enjoyment—perhaps enjoying God’s presence.

<span class="sc">Eagle:</span> Enjoying God is a good start, but a good purpose can’t be selfish. It must focus on others. Thus we can’t merely _enjoy_ God, but we must have a relationship with him. Relationships produce meaning.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> But the foundation of relationships are shared experiences. We feast with friends and tell stories—relationships with the past. Relationships are important but not fundamental. They are only a higher-order sort of _enjoyment_.

<span class="sc">Eagle:</span> I’m not so sure you can reduce relationships to mere enjoyment like this …

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> Plato agreed with you. He emphatically distinguished the _enjoyable_ and the _good_. To him, a pastry may be enjoyable, but to be good is to have a well-ordered soul that leads to piety and justice. While I agree with Plato that all enjoyable things are not good, I don’t think the concepts can be split so cleanly. Take any just action and ask _why_ repeatedly, and you’ll hit the foundation of enjoyment. Why not steal your neighbors’ food? So they don’t starve. Why don’t they want to starve? Because they want to live. Why do they want to live? Because they _enjoy_ living. Thus, I think justice is an empty concept without enjoyment.

<span class="sc">Eagle:</span> I’m saying relationships are fundamental. Plato says the good is fundamental. You say _enjoyment_ is fundamental—

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> I don’t think enjoyment is fundamental, but only that the good and relationships would be meaningless without enjoyment, and thus they can not be fundamental. Perhaps none of them are fundamental.

<span class="sc">Eagle:</span> You say relationships aren’t fundamental, but how could there be an afterlife if we didn’t have souls in some form? Aren’t relationships just the most basic connection between souls? I think you’re applying your physicalist worldview to the problems of meaning and the afterlife.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> You’re right that I approach these issues as a physicalist, but I don’t think you can brush aside my arguments quite so quickly. Do you believe our souls are present here on Earth?

<span class="sc">Eagle:</span> Of course.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> And do you agree that our relationships here are built on shared experiences?

<span class="sc">Eagle:</span> Yes, although both enjoyable and unenjoyable ones.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> Thus, unless relationships in heaven are different, my argument stands.

<span class="sc">Eagle:</span> Heaven _is_ different. “What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the human heart conceived, what God has prepared for those who love him.”

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> The mystical escape hatch—it may be correct, but it does tend to end the conversations.

As you know, I don’t believe there is an afterlife. Of course this disappoints me. Still, some people think if there is no afterlife, then even our short lives here must be meaningless—a breath in the wind. I don’t think this is true. Earlier, you said “if the past is completely forgotten, it must be meaningless.” While you may be forgotten, you still _did_ exist. You _did_ live justly. You _did_ love and build relationships. Why must meaning be yoked to permanence?

Either both worldviews are meaningful, both are meaningless, or the mystic is correct. If there is meaning, enjoyment must be its foundation, as much as ascetics like Socrates dismiss pastries and coffee.

<span class="sc">Eagle:</span> I hope I haven’t frustrated you. Does it surprise you that I believe we can’t comprehend what heaven is like?

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> No, it doesn’t. Mysticism frustrates my mind, but its unfair to call it an “escape hatch” since that implies you are using it to win an argument. I’m certainly not frustrated with you. And I don’t think the mystical argument is unwarranted.

<span class="sc">Eagle:</span> I’m glad to hear it. So, I think relationships are fundamental and that our relationship with God, while unlike Earthly relationships, is what makes heaven worthwhile. Without it, eternal life would be hell. I better go. I enjoy our conversations.

<span class="sc">Dijon:</span> As do I! Thanks for your patience with me.

<span class="sc">Eagle:</span> Good night.
