I realized, after working with a colleague all week, how much my coffee-drinking disrupts my work day. Each morning he’d be ready, but I would need a cup of coffee. An hour later he’d be focused on work, but I would need to urinate. After lunch he’d be ready to continue, but I would need another cup to clear my head. I probably spent fifteen to thirty minutes acquiring and disposing of coffee each day.

All activities and choices have an end, or purpose. Why do I drink coffee?

Although I enjoy it, its main purpose it to keep me focused on more important ends. Thus, to be a net good, the coffee would need to save more than fifteen to thirty minutes of work each day. I don’t think it does. Not only does it take time from my work, but I also will get a cup of coffee to push off working. If I set a more consistent sleep schedule and ate lighter lunches, the caffeine would be less necessary, and there are safe and reliable caffeine pills that I could use in a pinch.

If coffee drinking extends my workday and takes away time from my wife and daughter, I should stop drinking it. I can still drink coffee in social situations when its sole purpose is mutual enjoyment.

Many people would not consider the choice to drink coffee to be an ethical decision, but I think it *is* an ethical decision—just a small one.
