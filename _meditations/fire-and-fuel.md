Nāgārjuna was an Indian Mahāyāna Buddhist scholar-saint.

His most famous work, the _Mūlamadhyamakakārikā_, is a sequence of arguments showing that one thing after another does not have _svabhāva_. Svabhāva is Sanskrit term translated to “own-being”, “essence”, “inherent existence”, “true identity” or “intrinsic nature”. If something has svabhāva, it’s “independent of anything else, uncaused, and not fabricated from other things.”

Nāgārjuna held if there _were_ ultimately real things, then they must have svabhāva, but there can be no such things. Nāgārjuna is not a nihilist. He believes banyan trees exist in some sense, only not in the ultimate sense.

What is meant by the _ultimate sense_? Buddhists distinguish the ultimately true from the conventionally true. A statement is _conventionally true_ if action based on its acceptance leads to successful practice. A statement is _ultimately true_ if it corresponds to the nature of reality and neither asserts nor presupposes the existence of any mere conceptual fiction. “A conceptual fiction is something that is thought to exist only because of facts about us concept-users and the concepts that we happen to employ. For instance, a chariot is a conceptual fiction. When a set of parts is assembled in the right way, we only believe there is a chariot in addition to the parts because of our interests and our cognitive limitations.”

The chariot is conventionally real, as it’s made of parts. The chariot wheel is conventionally real, as it’s made of wood. The wood is conventionally real, as it’s made of cells. The cell’s are conventionally real, as they’re made of atoms. The atoms are conventionally real, as they’re made of smaller particles. What about these smaller particles?

As best I can tell, modern physics described the universe as a single _wave function_. This wave function encompasses everything. It evolves according to the fixed laws of nature. These smaller particles, like elements, molecules, things, selves, and all other terms in our language, are ways of talking about this universal wave function. The division between the particle and it’s surroundings is arbitrary, and particle can be entangled to other parts of the universe, making its behavior inseparable from everything else. Thus the smaller particles are conventionally real, as they’re a way of talking about the universal wave function.

I thought that the universal wave function had svabhāva, because it is “independent of anything else, uncaused, and not fabricated from other things.” However, the term svabhāva is abstract and difficult to translate. I’m not in a position to question what is meant by this term. And so, I think its reasonable to agree that nothing has svabhāva.

I disagree with Nāgārjuna on another, very related, point: He says if there were ultimately real things, then they would be things with svabhāva. I don’t think this is the case.

The nature of my disagreement is best illustrated with an example. In book ten, Nāgārjuna shows that fire and fuel have no intrinsic nature:

<blockquote class="prose">
<p>If fire were different than fuel,</p>
<p>Then it would burn even without it.</p>
<p>Fire would burn forever,</p>
<p>It would not arise from what causes it to burn,</p>
<p>Trying to light it would be pointless,</p>
<p>And it would not relate to any object.</p>
<p>Because it would not depend on anything else,</p>
<p>It would not arise from what causes it to burn.</p>
<p>Because it would burn eternally,</p>
<p>Lighting it would be pointless.</p>
</blockquote>

This analysis correctly refutes the view that fire has svabhāva. If something has svabhāva, it’s independent of anything else, uncaused and not fabricated from other things. We observe that fire doesn’t exist apart from fuel and it can’t light itself, thus fire has no svabhāva.

Fire was once thought to be an element. Now it is known to be a chemical process, converting fuel and oxygen into heat, light, and oxidized fuel. Thus, modern science also agrees with Nāgārjuna that fire has no svabhāva.

According to Nāgārjuna’s thinking, this lack of svabhāva implies that fire is a conceptual fiction—it’s merely _conventionally_ real but not ultimately real.

To me, a convention is something that could be another way. For example, cars could drive on the right side or the left side. By saying that fire conventionally exists, I presume this means fire could be another way. For example, if a tribe never saw fire apart from volcanoes then they may speak of volcanoes but never of fire. Not only would this tribe not have a word for fire but they wouldn’t even conceive of fire apart from volcanoes.

If this is what it means for fire to be a conceptual fiction, it seems like a small fiction. Processes like fire emerge from the laws of nature. Particles emerge as patterns within the universe’s wave function. From particles emerge oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and from these emerge fire. Our thoughts and language model these patterns to navigate reality. Models are approximate. If we apply a model to a new purpose, then we may be lead astray. Models are intentional. They reflect the interests of their creators. Just because a model has a creator doesn’t mean the thing being modeled is a conventional. Just because people refer to things with a term, doesn’t mean the thing referred to with the terms is a convention.

It seems to me that saying that nothing has svabhāva is to say that all objects are changing. This is true, but the processes by which _objects_ change is permanent. Thus, the laws of nature provide a second-order permanence to things. This is why fire always acts like fire. I predict that alien species would describe, or model, fire roughly the same way we do. Likewise, Chinese, English, and Arabic speakers think similarly. Linguists have found differences, but they’re slight.

Thus, I agree that nothing has svabhāva, yet I think there exist ultimately real things.

Several objections can be raised here.

Perhaps the laws of physics aren’t fixed? And maybe there isn’t a thing-in-itself to be found underneath our sensory perceptions? While both statements could be true, it seems unlikely. I’m drawing the best conclusion I can with the evidence I have. We all must do this. We have _certain_ knowledge of very little.

I would need strong evidence to disregard the permanence of the laws of physics and the ultimate reality that originates with them. Maybe meditation and direction perception could provide such strong evidence?

The qualitative nature of sight, hearing, and touch (qualia) are mysterious and don’t feel like they’re embedded in the laws of nature. And all the arguments against qualia I’ve found are arguments against our _memories of qualia_, but they don’t refute the fundamental mystery which is how they _feel_ to me _at this very moment_. Whether I remember the taste of last decade’s coffee or yesterday’s coffee is unimportant.

Apart from qualia, I see no reason to put our direct experiences on an epistemological pedestal. Apart from qualia, I see no reason to suspect our mind could reach down and know something about deep metaphysical truths that are beyond the reach particle accelerators, careful reasoning, and mathematics.

If the mind could do this, I’d expect those that have dived into the deep would emerge on the surface of physical reality with the same story. Yet this doesn’t appear to be the case. Buddhism is as bifurcated as Protestantism. That is, there is more agreement than disagreement, but still a lot of disagreement. The simplest explanation, or so it seems to me, is that we’re a bundle of motors and sensors stuck floating on the surface, unable to look beyond it.

It may be that the directly perceived truths the divers discover can’t be communicated. This mystical explanation may be true, but then why do the divers return with specific stories of other realms, divas, exotic places? Why would they be so confident about their ability to communicate their findings to us?

Meditating helps me connect with those around me. I also don’t doubt that there are higher states of conciousness that are well-explored in the East. I will try to climb into these mountains so I can see for myself, but from what I can gather here on the ground, it doesn’t seem like they’ll reveal fire to be a conceptual fiction without ultimate reality.

If the human mind was metaphysically special, it would require a dramatic epistemological shift. We would no longer be bundles of sensors and motors floating in a vast world, but somehow a antenna

Why is it so important that nothing has svabhāva? Suffering is overcome, in part, by realizing that nothing has svabhāva. Is it also important that nothing ultimately exists?
