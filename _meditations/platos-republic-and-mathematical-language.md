Socrates, in the _Republic_, assumes that language is as precise as math. For example, in book four, he says if his imaginary city is good then it is “wise, courageous, moderate, and just.” This is a reasonable definition of _good_, although I hesitate to say it’s complete. Socrates’ does not hesitate, and he uses this definition to launch a curious analysis:

<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, just as with any other four things, if we were seeking any one of them in something or other and recognized the other three first, this would also suffice for the recognition of the thing looked for. For plainly it couldn’t be anything but what’s left over. With these things too, since they happen to be four, mustn’t we look for them in the same way?</p>
</blockquote>

It’s as if Socrates defined _good_ using a summation:

<blockquote>
<p>good = wise + courageous + moderate + just</p>
</blockquote>

Therefore, we can define _just_ using a subtraction:

<blockquote>
<p>just = good - wise - courageous - moderate</p>
</blockquote>

This reasoning only works if the definition is complete. If it isn’t complete, you’ll have extra terms:

<blockquote>
<p>good = wise + courageous + moderate + just + X + Y</p>
</blockquote>

If we move the known terms to the right side of the equation, we’d be unable to separate the meaning of _just_ from the unknown terms:

<blockquote>
<p>just + X + Y = good - wise - courageous - moderate</p>
</blockquote>

Furthermore, this mathematical definition of _just_, to be a valid, would require a precise knowledge of _good_, _wise_, _courageous_, and _moderate_.

Neither assumption seems correct.

Terms model a complex reality. Like all models, they are approximate. We usually call bananas _and_ lemons yellow, even though we know they are different colors, because we usually don’t mind losing this information. If we want to be more precise, we can call the lemon _neon yellow_. Yet, of course the lemon has many colors. When we say it is neon yellow, we mean its predominant color is neon yellow. We could use a more detailed description, but it would remain an approximation of the actual lemon.

If a concrete term like _yellow_ is an incomplete and approximate model of reality, then abstract terms like _good_, _just_, _wise_, _courageous_, and _moderate_ probably are too. This doesn’t mean these terms are useless. In fact, terms are useful _because_ they are approximate! They let us communicate only the details relevant to a particular situation. This is the same process that turns chronicles into history by condensing facts into meaningful narrative.

This doesn’t mean the _good_ is entirely relative. It only means the _good_ is a term is an approximate model of reality. It is not a thing in-and-of-itself.

So why does Plato treat language this way? I think he was enamored with the precision and beauty of mathematics, and so he wanted to appropriate this beauty to ideas he cared deeply about.
