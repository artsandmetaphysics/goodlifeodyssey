  A brief consideration of one example of Plato’s mathematical analysis of words, which informs us how he thought language works.

Socrates, in the _Republic_, assumes that language is as precise as math. For example, in book four, he says if his imaginary city is _good_ then it is “wise, courageous, moderate, and just.” This is a reasonable definition of _good_, although I hesitate to say it’s complete. Socrates’ does not hesitate, and he uses this definition to launch a curious analysis:

<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, just as with any other four things, if we were seeking any one of them in something or other and recognized the other three first, this would also suffice for the recognition of the thing looked for. For plainly it couldn’t be anything but what’s left over. With these things too, since they happen to be four, mustn’t we look for them in the same way?</p>
</blockquote>

It’s as if Socrates defined _good_ using a summation:

<blockquote>
<p>good = wise + courageous + moderate + just</p>
</blockquote>

Therefore, we can define _just_ using a subtraction:

<blockquote>
<p>just = good − wise − courageous − moderate</p>
</blockquote>

This reasoning may work if Socrates’ four-part definition is complete. If it isn’t complete, you’ll have extra terms:

<blockquote>
<p>good = wise + courageous + moderate + just + X + Y</p>
</blockquote>

When we move the known terms to the right side of the equation, we’d be unable to isolate the _just_ from the unknown terms:

<blockquote>
<p>just + X + Y = good − wise − courageous − moderate</p>
</blockquote>

Furthermore, this mathematical definition of _just_, to be a valid, would require a precise knowledge of _good_, _wise_, _courageous_, and _moderate_.

Neither assumption seems correct. There are additional terms and we do not have precise knowledge of the listed terms.

Terms are models of a complex reality. Like all models, they are approximate. This can be most easily seen in a concrete example. We usually call bananas _and_ lemons yellow, even though we know they are different colors. The distinction between the color of a banana and the color of a lemon is usually unimportant for our purposes. If we want to be more precise, say when we’re selecting a paint for our daughter’s room, we use a swatch that precisely associates colors to specific names. Returning to our lemon, we may call it _neon yellow_. This phrase is a more precise model. Yet, of course, the lemon has many colors, and when we say it is neon yellow we mean _its predominant color_ is neon yellow. We could use a more detailed description, but it would remain an approximation of the actual lemon.

If a concrete term, like _yellow_, is an incomplete and approximate model of reality, then abstract terms, like _good_, _just_, _wise_, _courageous_, and _moderate_, probably are too. This doesn’t mean these terms are useless. In fact, terms are useful _because_ they are approximate! They let us omit the irrelevant details. For example, when my wife asks me to dress Elanor in her yellow pants, I know what to do. It’s tedious and unnecessary for her to provide a more precise color name since is only one pair of pants matches the description. If there were several yellow pants to choose from, a more precise description would be given. Our beautiful world is filled with details. My wedding ring abounds with details I’m unaware of. Reducing and organizing these details is a large part of the human experience. Photographers choose what to include in their shot. Software engineers organize a small piece of the world into their databases. Historians turn chronicles into meaningful narrative.

If the _good_ is a model of reality, then what is it a model of? It is a model of human behavior. It is an abstract model, built using more concrete terms which are themselves models, which in turn are built from even more concrete terms, and so on until there is a more or less direct correspondence between the terms and reality. As humanity faces new problems, say dilemmas posed by modern medicine or nuclear warfare, we refine our model.

Just because the _good_ isn’t a thing-in-itself doesn’t mean the _good_ doesn’t exist. There _is_ an underlying reality that humans act within. Nor does it mean the _good_ is more conventional than it would be if it were a thing-in-itself. For, if the _good_ was an ontological primitive, say one of Plato’s forms, what reason could we have for desiring it that couldn’t still be given? I still believe there is a good way to act and a bad way. It is, however, like the true nature of the lemon, so complex we can’t fully comprehend it. Thus, we’re left with our approximate models, our terminology, our words. When we run into new situations, we must work hard to refine our model as a human society.

So why does Plato treat language this way? I think he was enamored with the precision and beauty of mathematics, and so he wanted to appropriate this precision and beauty to the ideas he cared deeply about, such as the _good_ and the _just_.
