Plato mathematically analyzes words in the _Republic_. Here, I’ll briefly consider an instance of this curious reasoning. I suspect, given the Academy’s emphasis on mathematics, it is important.

In book four, Socrates says he hopes his imaginary city is “perfectly good”. To be good, he continues, is to be “wise, courageous, moderate, and just.” These four terms provide a reasonable definition of _good_, although I hesitate to say it’s complete. Socrates’ does not hesitate:

<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, just as with any other four things, if we were seeking any one of them in something or other and recognized the other three first, this would also suffice for the recognition of the thing looked for. For plainly it couldn’t be anything but what’s left over. With these things too, since they happen to be four, mustn’t we look for them in the same way?</p>
</blockquote>

It’s as if Socrates defined _good_ using a summation:

  Good = Wise + Courageous + Moderate + Just

Therefore, we can define _just_ using a subtraction:

  Just = Good - Wise - Courageous - Moderate

That one thinks this reasoning is valid tells you about how they view language.

First, it’s clear that the list of four items must be a complete description of Good. If it wasn’t complete, you would have an extra term:

  Good = Wise + Courageous + Moderate + Just + X

Therefore, after moving the known terms to the right side of the equation, you’d still have two unknown terms on the left:

  Just + X = Good - Wise - Courageous - Moderate

Thus, you wouldn’t be able to separate out Just from the unknown term.

This mathematical definition of Just, to be a valid, also requires we precisely know the meaning of Good, Wise, Courageous, and Moderate.
