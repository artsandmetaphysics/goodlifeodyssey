If God is supremely good then why does hell exist? I can accept that unrepentant sinners shouldn’t be in heaven, but why must they be eternally punished? Wouldn’t a supremely good God make unrepentant sinners, upon death, cease to exist instead of being eternally tormented? And if hell must exist to punish the guilty, then why does the torment last forever? What sin found in a finite life could justly lead to infinite pain?

Here’s an answer to these questions—a solution to the problem of hell: All of hell’s citizens _choose_ to be there. At any point, they could choose to go to heaven or to stop existing, but they want to exist in hell. This is especially plausible if the torments of hell are self-inflicted; there are no flames, lakes of ice, or armed demons.

Setting aside how the Bible describes hell, does this view even solve the problem? I think it does. A utilitarian may object: “Even though the sinners continually choose to be in hell, God knows they’d be better off not existing, so he should erase them.” Perhaps, but maybe God cares more about preserving our autonomy than minimizing some metric? Hell exists because God respects our free will.

Let’s consider a couple of variations on this view. Some theologians think there are only two choices: heaven or hell—non-existence is off the table. This view begs the original question. There would be souls in hell that would rather not exist, the sort of people that jump under trains—and these souls would be being tormented against their will. Since an all-powerful God _could_ allow souls to cease existing, the new question would be: If God is supremely good then why must souls exist in hell against their will?

Others agree that people choose to go to hell, but that the choice, once made, is permanent. Thus, a sinner in hell can’t decide to repent. This also begs the question, since why would a supremely good God keep people in eternal torment once they no longer wished to be there? It seems to me that the problem of hell is only solved if sinners _continually_ choose to exist in hell.

I hope it’s true that everyone gets to choose between heaven, hell, and non-existence.

If everyone goes to hell because they choose too, then I wouldn’t choose to go to hell. I _want_ to believe that Christianity is true, but I don’t believe it because the evidence—the structure of the physical universe, biological evolution, the bible’s inconsistencies, and the history of religions—doesn’t support it. Or so I believe. I have a finite, limited mind and very well could be wrong. If I die and find out I’m wrong, I’d be ecstatic.

It would mean that I could be in the presence of an all-loving God forever. It would mean all relationships could be as deep as the relationship between a couple who’s been married sixty years. It would mean I could continue enjoying existence.  Finally, it would mean God doesn’t arbitrarily require people to have faith in something that appears to be false to get into heaven.

Did Dante think that all of hell’s denizens choose to be there? I’ve asked myself this during the past few months as I’ve studied his masterpiece. It seems unlikely; some punishments appear to be with self-inflicted, but many are not. Consider the sowers of scandal in the ninth ditch of the eight circle, repeatedly healing and being cut open by a demon with a sword:

<blockquote class="poetry">
<p class="indent">No barrel, even though it’s lost a hoop</p>
<p>or end-piece, ever gaps as one whom I</p>
<p>saw ripped right from his chin to where we fart:</p>
<p class="indent">how bowels hung between his legs, one saw</p>
<p>his vitals and the miserable sack</p>
<p>that makes of what we swallow excrement.</p>
</blockquote>

This sinner looks up at Dante and asks why he is dawdling here. Virgil interjects and says “Death has not reached him yet, nor is it guilt that summons him to torment.” This isn’t a hell that someone would continually choose over non-existence. Rather, Dante’s hell is one filled with retributive justice—as it’s gate states: “justice urged on my high artificer.”

The idea that sinners all choose to go to hell solves a tough theological problem. Maybe he’s right, but it’s noteworthy that his conception contradicts the medieval conception of hell as a place of divine retribution and torment.
