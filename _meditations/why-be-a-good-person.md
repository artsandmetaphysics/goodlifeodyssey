  Why Should I be a Good Person?

I met the best man at my wedding in freshman biology lab. He was one of my three lab mates for the semester. Our shared interest in religion and politics grew into a close friendship; we’d discuss the existence of God and the merits of gun control while counting crickets and dissecting frogs. Our conversations continued for the next three years as roommates, and on to this day—although our favorite topics have changed.

The most persistent topic of those early years was this question: can there be a universal moral standard without God? The details have faded, but I’m sure I carry traces of these conversations in my thoughts today. I do remember that we, like good men in all ages, wanted to condemn bad men. We wanted to say “murder is wrong.” It wasn’t enough to say “most of us agree murder is wrong” or “murder is prohibited by law.” We wanted to say the businessman should act justly when nobody was looking.

Universal moral standards bring to mind the ten commandments—“Thou shalt not murder.” But universal moral standards can be situational. We could say: “Thou shalt not murder _except_ when it will save many lives.” A universal standard could be complex. Moral choice may depend on cultural background of the people involved, or it may depend on the weather. For example, you’re obligated to help hitchhikers during a deep freeze. It’s okay if the standard accounts for human belief. What is important is that the standard’s justification doesn’t _depend_ on our beliefs. Thus we wanted a foundation for our moral claims that didn’t depend on whim.

Standards tell us if something is good or bad. Is this painting beautiful? Is my country just? Is that person good? Without a standard there is no good or bad, therefore without a universal moral standard there is no universal idea of the good life. We’re left to make own good life odyssey.

We hadn’t solved the problem when I left for Boston to attend graduate school, and, although the problem continued to bother me, I considered it less often.

Reading Plato’s _Republic_, more than a decade later, I’m struck by how similar we were in our yearnings to Glaucon and Adeimantus who asked Socrates to extol justice for its own sake. We wanted the businessman not to cheat when no one was watching, and they wanted the man with the ring of invisibility not to murder the king when no one was watching. They expounded the problem in a purer form than we did and considered the perfectly just man who appeared perfectly unjust.

I’m also struck by the irony that I’d started the _Republic_ my freshman year but set it aside because I thought the city-soul analogy that Socrates introduces in book two was silly. If I hadn’t arrogantly dismissed Plato, maybe our conversations would have lead us further. Plato says dialectic is more effective than the written word because a teacher, like Socrates with Glaucon and Adeimantus throughout the _Republic_, can tailor their message to their students. A good teacher could have guided me past my arrogance and we could have built on Plato’s answer to our question: can there be a universal moral standard without God?

HOWEVER PLATO TURNS THIS AROUND:

For justice to be praised for its own sake then its benefits must come from within ourselves. If the benefits came from elsewhere, then justice would be a means to these benefits. Therefore, if justice can be praised for its own sake then justice can’t be defined by gods or the state. For example, justice couldn’t be defined by the laws in the Hebrew Bible. One may think it’s possible to define justice through divine decree yet still praise it for its own sake: “God wants what is best for us because he loves us, and he knows what is best for us because he’s all knowing. Therefore, we should follow his laws because it’s best for us. Thus, justice is good for its own sake.” But such a justice is not be defined by God but only revealed by God. It would still be good to follow such a form of justice even if God didn’t exist and we’d found it on our own using reason. A Christian may object to this: “But God created us! Furthermore, you can’t separate what is best for us from God, for what is best for us would be different if God did not exist.” This is a valid point. It questions the utility of Adeimantus’ question. Why is it important that justice be praised for its own sake? I’m not going to consider this question further here. Instead, I’ll assume Adeimantus’ question was the right one.

A justice that can be praised for its own sake would have to benefit us directly—being just is good and it would make us happier. Thus, an unjust person is hurting themselves although they don’t know it. They’re ignorant. They may say “I’m happier being unjust,” but they’re mistaken. All we can do is pity them. Thus, Blayne and I would look at the businessman who is cheating and we could pity them for they would be happier if they did not cheat.

Plato thought justice was balance between the parts of our soul. Injustice is imbalance. For example, we cheat on our taxes because we want more money so we can satisfy the appetitive part of our soul. The unjust man is less human than the just man. They’re allowing the bestial parts of their soul take over. As rational beings, we are most properly being ourselves by letting the rational part rule.

One may ask: Won’t rationality allow you to get more of what you want? Reason doesn’t tell you what you _should_ do, but how to do it. There are facts and values. Reason can’t tell us what to value. Plato would disagree. He’d ask you why you
