  My impression of _Ravelstein_, by Saul Bellow.

_Ravelstein_ is Saul Bellow’s final novel—a memoir of his great-souled friend and co-lecturer Allan Bloom. My wife and I listened to a capable man read the book, an hour or two at a time in the evenings.

I hadn’t heard of Bellow. My dad told me that he had tried reading _The Adventures of Augie March_ in college and couldn’t get into it. _Ravelstein_ kept my attention because I wanted to learn what Bloom was like. Also, the audio format propels one past the unfamiliar foreign phrases and proper nouns, encouraging adherence to Mortimer Adler’s tip to read stories “quickly and with total immersion.” Not that _Ravelstein_ had much of a story. Bellow’s pledge to write his friend’s memoir was the only plot. Still, my interest in Bloom and the punchy descriptions kept my interest until the tenth and final chapter, which was too long.

What did I learn? Not much new about Bloom’s ideas but a lot about his person. Plato, his oracle, mixed poetry with philosophy in his dialogues. This is why Socrates is compelling. Bloom’s philosophy is found in _The Closing of the American Mind_, but he wanted poetry too. I think that’s why he asked Bellow to write the memoir. Maybe he hoped his person, a “really important” subject, would direct someone’s eros towards the great books, or maybe the rational part of his soul couldn’t tame the honour-loving spirited part. Certainly the appetitive part was never tamed, given the Jensen teapots, Quimper antique plates, suits, audio equipment, BMW splurge, and so on. His materialism surprised me. His interest in the Chicago Bulls also surprised me. So did his love of gossip and his eating habits.

His nobility shined through these flaws. His impulse to teach, which was strong until the end, was endearing. He was also a sincere friend. His network of past students attests to this, as did the scene when he left the city for the country to inspect Bellow’s failing marriage. Bloom, like Socrates says in the Phaedrus, didn’t like the country. He thought the country was bad for you: “All educated people make the same mistake—they think that nature and solitude are good for them. Nature and solitude are poison.”
