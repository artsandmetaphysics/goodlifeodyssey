  My impression of _Ravelstein_, by Saul Bellow.

_Ravelstein_ is Saul Bellow’s final novel—a memoir of his great-souled friend and co-lecturer Allan Bloom. My wife and I listened to it in the evenings over the course of a couple weeks.

I hadn’t heard of Bellow. My dad told me that he had started _The Adventures of Augie March_ in college and couldn’t get into it, but _Ravelstein_ kept my attention. I wanted to know what Bloom was like, since I just read his famous book. The audiobook format also helped propel us past the unfamiliar foreign phrases and proper nouns, and encouraged us to follow Mortimer Adler’s suggestion to read stories “quickly and with total immersion.” Not that _Ravelstein_ was a story. The only plot was Bellow’s pledge to write the memoir and his struggle to do so. Still, my interest in Bloom, coupled with the humor and delightful descriptions, kept us listening. Only the tenth and final chapter dragged a bit.

What did I learn about Bloom? Not much new about his ideas but a lot about his person. This was intentional. To Bloom, proper philosophy is a way of life. He wanted his personality to be remembers. This is why he asked Bellow to write the memoir. Socrates was a personality because Plato mixes poetry with philosophy in his dialogues. Bloom had shared his philosophy in _The Closing of the American Mind_, but he wanted the poetry too. Maybe he hoped he could posthumously guide more young Americans to the great books, or maybe the rational part of his soul hadn’t tamed the spirited part. Certainly his appetitive part was untamed—think of the Jensen teapots, Quimper antique plates, audio equipment, BMW splurge, and so on. His materialism surprised me. So did his interest in the Chicago Bulls, his love of gossip, and his slopping eating habits.

His nobility shined through these flaws. His impulse to teach, which was strong until the end, was endearing. He was a sincere friend. His relationships with past students shows this, as did the trip out of the city to inspect Bellow’s failing marriage. Bloom, like Socrates in the Phaedrus, didn’t like the country. He thought it was bad for you: “All educated people make the same mistake—they think that nature and solitude are good for them. Nature and solitude are poison.”

Chatting with my wife after, we remembered a few encounters. The man with the green ink, in particular, horrified me:

<blockquote>
<p>Rakhmiel was highly educated, but to what end? Every corner of his apartment was stuffed with books. Every morning, Rakhmiel sat down and wrote in green ink…. His mind was made up once and for all upon hundreds of subjects and maybe this was the sign that he had completed his course.</p>
</blockquote>

“To what end?” I don’t yet have a clear _idea of the good_, but somehow this encounter with Rakhmiel and his green ink showed me that education for its own sake is unappealing. Bloom and Socrates would disagree. Maybe they’d even say a poet is misleading me, and I need to chant the logical countercharm under my breath.
