<li><em>Meter</em> is the basic rhythmic structure of a line.</li>
<li>In English, the meter is usually determined by the patter of stressed syllables.</li>
<li>A <em>syllable</em> is the phonological building blocks of words.</li>
<li>Syllables usually have one vowel and zero or more consonants. E.g., "ee", "bee", or "bees".</li>
<li>A <em>foot</em> is a combination of stressed and unstressed syllables.</li>
<li>Stressed syllables are often denoted by a line. (Imagine a taught string.)</li>
<li>Unstressed syllables are often denoted by a little "u". (Imagine a relaxed string.)</li>
<li>An iamb goes ˘¯.</li>
<li>An trochee goes ¯˘.</li>
<li>A dactyl goes ¯˘˘.</li>
