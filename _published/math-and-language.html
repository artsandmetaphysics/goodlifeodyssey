<h2>Terms</h2>
<p>A <em>phrase</em> is one or more words.</p>
<p>A <em>term</em> is a distinct concept, represented by a phrase.</p>
<p>A phrase may be used to refer to more than one term. Which term is
intended in a particular case must be inferred.</p>
<p>A <em>standard definition</em> is a description of the terms a phrase
conventionally refers to.</p>
<p>A <em>local definition</em> is a description of the term a phrase
refers to within a well-defined context. E.g., legal contracts and
technical standards use local definitions that only apply within
themselves.</p>
<p>Usually there are alternate descriptions which could be used to
define a term.</p>
<p>To aid memory, local definitions are often assigned to phrases with
related standard definitions. E.g., my local definition of the words
“local definition” and “standard definition” are related to definitions
more broadly and to the software programmer’s use of locally defined
entities as well as standard entities provided and used by a larger
group.</p>
<p>Such documents often stylize the words that refer to these locally
defined terms. E.g., they bold or italicize them. This practice prevents
ambiguity if words may refer to either local and standard definitions,
but I think it also muddles the documents. Thus, I only italicize
locally defined terms sparingly after their first use. When I want to
refer to words, as opposed to terms, I place the words in quotes.</p>
<p>Standard definitions change, usually slowly.</p>
<p>Local definitions, if provided as a precaution due to this change,
may even be identical to standard definition used at a point in
time.</p>
<p>Several standard definitions may be attached to a term
simultaneously, by different groups of people. The groups can be
separated geographically. E.g., American English differs subtly from
British English. They can also be separated in time. E.g., a younger
generation using a term differently than their parents.</p>
<p>While a standard definition can be thought of as a local definition
whose context is a particular group of people, I will not use the term
in this way.</p>
<p>An individual may be aware of multiple standard definitions, and may
use them appropriately within context.</p>
<p>A local definition can not be wrong. It can only be useless.</p>
<p>A standard definition can be wrong if it is not what is
conventionally meant by a group when they use a term.</p>
<p>Authors don’t always make their local definitions explicit.</p>
<p>Sometimes authors want their local definition to become the standard
definition.</p>
<p>Since standard definitions change, reading older documents can be
difficult. E.g., Shakespeare’s plays are difficult to read because they
use old unknown words and because they use words whose meaning has
changed.</p>
<p>To interpret documents like their original readers we must share
their standard definitions. This can be a legal concern. E.g., when
interpreting the original intent of the U.S. Constitution. It can also
be a religious concern. E.g., when interpreting the original intent of
the words of inspired religious figures.</p>
<h2>Models</h2>
<p>Language and mathematics let us describe things.</p>
<p>Any mathematical proposition <em>could</em> be restated with
words.</p>
<p>A <em>model</em> is a simplified description of what exists.</p>
<p>Most models are incomplete in the sense that there exist verifiable
questions that could be asked of the thing described that can’t be
answered by the model.</p>
<p>Most models are also approximate; there exist verifiable questions
that could be asked of the thing described that would be answered
incorrectly by the model.</p>
<p>There is a tradeoff between how easy a description is to use and how
complex it is.</p>
<p>Two models are equivalent if they allow one to answer the same set of
questions about the thing and they give the same answers.</p>
<p>A model is more detailed than another if it can answer everything the
other model can answer, as well as additional questions.</p>
<p>There can be many models of the same thing, each answering questions
about a different facet of the thing.</p>
<p>There can conceivably be complete models. A complete model is
sufficient to answer any verifiable question about the thing.</p>
<p>There may be non-verifiable metaphysical questions about a thing.
Such questions aren’t necessarily invalid. E.g., why are the laws of
physics the way they are?</p>
<p>What do we mean by a thing? Even the demarcation of the thing is a
model, and often an approximate one. A simple solution to this is to say
the entire universe is one thing—one big quantum wave function. I
believe this is one interpretation of quantum physics.</p>
<p>How would we know if a model is complete? Typically, you don’t.</p>
<p>The laws of physics aim to be a complete model of how the universe’s
state changes. It is not a complete model of the universe, which would
require knowledge of its initial state too.</p>
<p>There isn’t enough space in the universe to create a complete model
of itself.</p>
<p>We don’t know if the laws of physics completely describe how the
universe’s state changes. The laws could be different in other parts of
the universe, at different times, or even in different local or global
states. E.g., the gravitational constant could shift over time. If
matter is arranged a certain way, say into a brain-like structure, the
laws of physics could change within the brain. More fantastical examples
are also possible; it could be the case that if a golden box with a
particular shape were created then the laws of physics would change
throughout the universe.</p>
<p>A complete model of a thing is not the thing.</p>
<h2>Terms are Models</h2>
<p>Terms are models.</p>
<p>The statement, “there are two yellow pillows on my couch,” is a
model.</p>
<p>Most of our terms are only good enough for their standard ways it is
used in our language. Most standard uses of language don’t require
particularly complex models.</p>
<p>Specialists tend to need more granular models. Thus, they produce
local definitions within their fields to supplement the library of
standard terms. E.g., lawyers, doctors, engineers, and philosophers have
their own lingo.</p>
<p>Children learn their first terms using examples. Adults often learn
new terms using other terms they are already familiar with, but not
always. E.g., your friend may hold up a new fruit at the grocery and
tell you it’s name.</p>
<p>Many abstract terms must be learned using existing terms. E.g., could
<em>democracy</em> be taught using sensory examples?</p>
<p>Since terms are defined with other terms, their definitions tend to
be circular.</p>
<p>A term can be more or less understood. This can break problems with
circularity.</p>
