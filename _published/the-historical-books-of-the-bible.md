<h2>Joshua: Flexible nature of the text</h2>
<p>Joshua 5.30--35 is likely a late addition to the book, since it is placed in different parts of the story in different scrolls. A Dead Sea Scroll text places it after the second circumcisions in 5.2. The Septuagint places it after the gathering of kings in 9.2. Josephus, in <em>The Antiquities of the Jews</em> places it after the division of land. R. Ishmael places it at the end of the book. This is concrete evidence that some edits were being made to the text after it was written. In this case, the addition makes sense since it fills in a "hole" in the story---without this passage Deuteronomy 27.3--8 is not fulfilled.</p>
<h2>Genocide and the Incomplete Conquest</h2>
<p>God wanted his people to be separated from the Canaanites who were in the land. Leviticus 18 says that these people were sexually immoral and defiled the land. Deuteronomy 12 says they sacrificed their children to their gods.</p>
<p>There are two textual difficulties with the conquest of Canaan. First, it is genocidal. Second, it seems like it was not as complete as it was meant to be.</p>
<p>The archaeological record discredits the historicity of Joshua.</p>
<p>Here are a few verses about demonstrating that the conquests were meant to completely eliminate those present in the land:</p>
<blockquote><p>
And at the seventh time, when the priests had blown the trumpets, Joshua
said to the people, “Shout! For the LORD has given you the city. The
city and all that is in it shall be devoted to the LORD for destruction.
Only Rahab the prostitute and all who are with her in her house shall
live because she hid the messengers we sent. As for you, keep away from
the things devoted to destruction, so as not to covet and take any of
the devoted things and make the camp of Israel an object for
destruction, bringing trouble upon it. But all silver and gold, and
vessels of bronze and iron, are sacred to the LORD; they shall go into
the treasury of the LORD.” So the people shouted, and the trumpets were
blown. As soon as the people heard the sound of the trumpets, they
raised a great shout, and the wall fell down flat; so the people charged
straight ahead into the city and captured it. Then they devoted to
destruction by the edge of the sword all in the city, both men and
women, young and old, oxen, sheep, and donkeys.<br />
— Joshua 6.16--21
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
When Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and
that the smoke of the city was rising, then they turned back and struck
down the men of Ai. And the others came out from the city against them;
so they were surrounded by Israelites, some on one side, and some on the
other; and Israel struck them down until no one was left who survived or
escaped. But the king of Ai was taken alive and brought to Joshua.
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
So Joshua took all that land: the hill country and all the Negeb and all
the land of Goshen and the lowland and the Arabah and the hill country
of Israel and its lowland, from Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir, as
far as Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon below Mount Hermon. He took all
their kings, struck them down, and put them to death. Joshua made war a
long time with all those kings. There was not a town that made peace
with the Israelites, except the Hivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon; all
were taken in battle. For it was the LORD’s doing to harden their hearts
so that they would come against Israel in battle, in order that they
might be utterly destroyed, and might receive no mercy, but be
exterminated, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.<br />
— Joshua 11.16--20
</p></blockquote>

<p>The conquest of the land, however, was not complete. This is difficult to explain, since if God promised something, and God is all-powerful, then how did it not come to pass? There are a few explanations for this reaching as far back as Deuteronomy.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Do not be terrified by them, for the LORD your God, who is among you, is
a great and awesome God. The LORD your God will drive out those nations
before you, little by little. You will not be allowed to eliminate them
all at once, or the wild animals will multiply around you. But the LORD
your God will deliver them over to you, throwing them into great
confusion until they are destroyed. He will give their kings into your
hand, and you will wipe out their names from under heaven. No one will
be able to stand up against you; you will destroy them.<br />
— Deuteronomy 7.21--4
</p></blockquote>

<p>Joshua 9 explains how the Gibeonites tricked the Israelites. They made it look like they came from far away, and asked to make a treaty.</p>
<blockquote><p>
So the leaders partook of their provisions, and did not ask direction
from the LORD. And Joshua made peace with them, guaranteeing their lives
by a treaty; and the leaders of the congregation swore an oath to
them.<br />
— Joshua 9.14--5
</p></blockquote>

<p>Joshua then discovers they had been tricked, and summons them, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>
"Why did you deceive us, saying, ‘We are very far from you,’ while in
fact you are living among us? Now therefore you are cursed, and some of
you shall always be slaves, hewers of wood and drawers of water for the
house of my God.” They answered Joshua, “Because it was told to your
servants for a certainty that the LORD your God had commanded his
servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the
inhabitants of the land before you; so we were in great fear for our
lives because of you, and did this thing. And now we are in your hand:
do as it seems good and right in your sight to do to us.” This is what
he did for them: he saved them from the Israelites; and they did not
kill them. But on that day Joshua made them hewers of wood and drawers
of water for the congregation and for the altar of the LORD, to continue
to this day, in the place that he should choose."<br />
— Joshua 9.22--27
</p></blockquote>

<p>In the second half of Joshua, the tribes are blamed for not driving out the inhabitants:</p>
<blockquote><p>
They did not, however, drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer: so
the Canaanites have lived within Ephraim to this day but have been made
to do forced labor.<br />
— Joshua 16.10
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
But the people of Judah could not drive out the Jebusites, the
inhabitants of Jerusalem; so the Jebusites live with the people of Judah
in Jerusalem to this day.<br />
— Joshua 16.63
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
Yet the Manassites could not take possession of those towns; but the
Canaanites continued to live in that land. But when the Israelites grew
strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but did not utterly
drive them out.<br />
— Joshau 17.12--13
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
The tribe of Joseph said, “The hill country is not enough for us; yet
all the Canaanites who live in the plain have chariots of iron, both
those in Beth-shean and its villages and those in the Valley of
Jezreel.” Then Joshua said to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and
Manasseh, “You are indeed a numerous people, and have great power; you
shall not have one lot only, but the hill country shall be yours, for
though it is a forest, you shall clear it and possess it to its farthest
borders; for you shall drive out the Canaanites, though they have
chariots of iron, and though they are strong.”<br />
— Joshau 17.16--18
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
There remained among the Israelites seven tribes whose inheritance had
not yet been apportioned. So Joshua said to the Israelites, “How long
will you be slack about going in and taking possession of the land that
the Lord, the God of your ancestors, has given you?<br />
— Joshua 18.2--3
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
So now I say, I will not drive them out before you; but they shall
become adversaries to you, and their gods shall be a snare to
you.”<br />
— Judges 2.3
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
So the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel; and he said,
“Because this people have transgressed my covenant that I commanded
their ancestors, and have not obeyed my voice, I will no longer drive
out before them any of the nations that Joshua left when he died.”<br />
— Judges 2.20--1
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
Now these are the nations that the Lord left to test all those in Israel
who had no experience of any war in Canaan (it was only that successive
generations of Israelites might know war, to teach those who had no
experience of it before): the five lords of the Philistines, and all the
Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived on Mount
Lebanon, from Mount Baal-hermon as far as Lebo-hamath.<br />
— Judges 3.1--3
</p></blockquote>

<p>These statements appear to conflict with other statements in Joshua:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Thus the Lord gave to Israel all the land that he swore to their
ancestors that he would give them; and having taken possession of it,
they settled there. And the Lord gave them rest on every side just as he
had sworn to their ancestors; not one of all their enemies had withstood
them, for the Lord had given all their enemies into their hands. Not one
of all the good promises that the Lord had made to the house of Israel
had failed; all came to pass.<br />
— Joshua 21.43--45
</p></blockquote>
