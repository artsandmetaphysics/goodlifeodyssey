<p>Why are you going on about ethics, and choices, and decisions? Well, we’ve relegated ethics to a corner, as if only special decisions are ethical. This is relativism letting us all decide things for ourselves, to have preferences, to live close to family or far as we please, to have one child or two or more as we please, to make a living this way or that as we please. It’s not the case though. There’s no clear division between ethical decisions and non-ethical, and everything we do is related. We don’t want stress and the largeness of choices to invade our everyday. This is a worthy goal, but we need to protect the everyday from a firm basis and not simply by re-defining ethics into special classes at university or silly training modules. Rather, lets say its unclear how to balance our duties when they conflict. We can think about them and ponder, but we may never know what the right choice is, and planning too much and filling our days with worry can’t be good.</p>
