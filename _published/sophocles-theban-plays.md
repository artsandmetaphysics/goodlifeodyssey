<h2>Oedipus the King</h2>
<p>Angered Tiresias implicates Oedipus:</p>
<blockquote><p>
So, you mock my blindness? Let me tell you this.<br />
You with your precious eyes,<br />
you're blind to the corruption of your life,<br />
to the house you live in, those you live with—<br />
who are your parents? Do you know? All unknowing<br />
you are the scourge of your own flesh and blood,<br />
the dead below the earth and the living here above,<br />
and the double lash of your mother and your father's curse<br />
will whip you from this land one day, their footfall<br />
treading you down in terror, darkness shrouding<br />
your eyes that can see the light!
</p></blockquote>

<p>The following quotations expresses two ideas central to the Greek world view. First, that the gods strip down the over-proud man, the man filled with hubris. Second, that we competition is healthy.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Destiny guide me always<br />
Destiny guide me filled with reverence<br />
pure in word and deed.<br />
Great laws tower above us, reared on high<br />
born for the brilliant vault of heaven—<br />
Olympian Sky their only father,<br />
nothing mortal, no man gave them birth,<br />
their memory deathless, never lost in sleep:<br />
within them lives a mighty god, the god does not<br />
grow old. Pride breeds the tyrant<br />
violent pride, gorging, crammed to bursting<br />
with all that is overripe and rich with ruin—<br />
clawing up to the heights, headlong pride<br />
crashes down the abyss—sheer doom!<br />
No footing helps, all foothold lost and gone.<br />
But the healthy strife that makes the city strong—<br />
I pray that god will never end that wrestling:<br />
god, my champion, I will never let you go.
</p></blockquote>

<p>These two ideas are present in many of the ancient Greek works; Hesiod, near the opening of <em>Works and Days</em>, speaks of strife that causes men to compete with one another, doing people good; Herodotus' stories highlight his belief that the gods tore down over-proud men—he also explicitly discusses this idea; the <em>Iliad</em> is filled with proud men striving with one other to "be the best."</p>
<p>The Chorus, after Oedipus is revealed:</p>
<blockquote><p>
O the generations of men<br />
the dying generations—adding the total<br />
of all your lives I find they come to nothing...<br />
does there exist, is there a man on earth<br />
who seizes more joy than just a dream, a vision?<br />
And the vision no sooner dawns than dies<br />
blazing into oblivion.<br />
You are my great example, you, your life<br />
your destiny, Oedipus, man of misery—<br />
I count no man blest.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Oedipus, chases after his wife and mother Jocasta:</p>
<blockquote><p>
His wife,<br />
no wife, his mother, where can eh find the mother earth<br />
that cropped two crops at once, himself and all his children?<br />
He was raging—one of the dark powers pointing the way,<br />
with a great shattering cry—someone, something leading him on—<br />
he hurled at the twin doors and bending the bolts back<br />
out of their sockets, crashed through the chamber.<br />
And there we saw the woman hanging by the neck,<br />
cradled high in a woven noose, spinning,<br />
swinging back and forth. And when he saw her,<br />
giving a low, wrenching sob that broke our hearts,<br />
slipped the halter from her throat, he eased her down,<br />
in a slow embrace he laid her down, poor thing...<br />
then, what came next, what horror we beheld!<br />
He rips off her brooches, the long gold pins<br />
holding her robes—and lifting them high,<br />
looking straight up into the points,<br />
he digs them down the sockets of his eyes, crying, "You,<br />
you'll see no more the pain I suffered, all the pain I caused!<br />
Too long you looked on the ones you never should have seen,<br />
blind to the ones you longed to see, to know! Blind<br />
from this hour on! Blind in the darkness—blind!"<br />
His voice like a dirge, rising, over and over<br />
raising the pins, raking them down his eyes.<br />
And at each stroke blood spurts from the roots,<br />
splashing his beard, a swirl of it, nerves and clots—<br />
black hail of blood pulsing, gushing down.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The Chorus, at the end of the play:</p>
<blockquote><p>
People of Thebes, my countrymen, look on Oedipus.<br />
He solved the famous riddle with his brilliance,<br />
he rose to power, a man beyond all power.<br />
Who could behold his greatness without envy?<br />
Now what a black sea of terror has overwhelmed him.<br />
Now as we keep our watch and wait the final day,<br />
count no many happy till he dies, free of pain at last.
</p></blockquote>

<p>This metric for judging the happy life is in Herodotus' fable of Solon meeting Croesus.</p>
<h2>Oedipus at Colonus</h2>
<blockquote><p>
Oh Theseus,<br />
dear friend, only the gods can never age,<br />
the gods can never die. All else in the world<br />
almighty Time obliterates, crushes all<br />
to nothing. The earth's strength wastes away,<br />
the strength of a man's body wastes and dies—<br />
faith dies, and bad faith comes to life,<br />
and the same wind of friendship cannot blow forever,<br />
holding steady and strong between two friends,<br />
much less between two cities.<br />
For some of us soon, for others later,<br />
joy turns to hate and back again to love.<br />
And even if all is summer sunshine now<br />
between yourself and Thebes,<br />
infinite Time, sweeping through its rounds<br />
gives birth to infinite nights and days...<br />
and a day will come when the treaties of an hour,<br />
the pacts firmed by a handclasp will snap—<br />
at the slightest word a spear will hurl them to the winds—<br />
some far-off day when my dead body, slumbering, buried<br />
cold in death, will drain their hot blood down,<br />
if Zeus is still Zeus and Apollo the son of god<br />
speaks clear and true.<br />
~ (685--707)
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
Here, stranger,<br />
here in the land of horses are a glory<br />
you have reached the noblest home on earth<br />
Colonus glistening, brilliant in the sun—<br />
where the nightingale sings on,<br />
her dying music rising clear,<br />
hovering always, never learning,<br />
down the shadows deepening green<br />
she haunts the glades, the wine-dark ivy,<br />
dense and dark the untrodden, sacred wood of god<br />
rich with laurel and olives never touched by the sun<br />
untouched by storms that blast from every quarter—<br />
where the Reveler Dionysus strides the earth forever<br />
where the wild nymphs are dancing round him<br />
nymphs who nursed his life.<br />
And here it blooms, fed by the dews of heaven<br />
lovely, clustering, morning-fresh forever,<br />
narcissus, crown of the Great Goddesss<br />
Mother and Daughter dying<br />
into life from the dawn of time,<br />
and the gold crocus bursts like break of day<br />
and the springs will never sleep, will never fail,<br />
the fountainhead of Cephisus flowing nomad<br />
quickening life forever, fresh each day—<br />
life rising up with the river's pure tide<br />
flowing over the plains, the swelling breast of earth—<br />
nor can the dancing Muses bear to leave this land<br />
or the Goddess Aphrodite, the charioteer<br />
with the golden reins of love.<br />
~ (761--89)
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
Suffer us to live here ... even in these straights<br />
our life is not as pitiful as you'd think,<br />
so long as we find joy in every hour.<br />
~ (909--11)
</p></blockquote>

<p>Oedipus declaring his innocence to Creon, in front of Theseus and the Athenians:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Unctuous, shameless—where do you think your insults<br />
do more damage, my old age or yours? Bloodshed<br />
incest, misery, all your mouth lets fly at me,<br />
I have suffered it all, and all against my will!<br />
Such was the pleasure of the gods, raging,<br />
perhaps, against our race from ages past.<br />
But as for me alone—<br />
say my unwilling crimes against myself<br />
and against my own were payment from the gods<br />
for something criminal deep inside me...no, look hard,<br />
you'll find no guilt to accuse me of—I am innocent!<br />
...<br />
And my mother...<br />
wretched man, have you no shame? Your own sister!<br />
Her marriage—forcing me to talk of that marriage!<br />
Oh I'll tell it all, I won't be silent, not now,<br />
you and your blasphemous mouth have gone so far.<br />
She was my mother, yes, she bore me—<br />
oh the horror—I knew nothing, she knew nothing!—<br />
and once she'd born me then she bore me children,<br />
her disgrace. But at least I know one thing:<br />
you slander her and me of your own free will,<br />
but I made her my bride against my will,<br />
I repeat this to the world against my will. No,<br />
I'll not be branded guilty, not in that marriage,<br />
not in the murder of my father, all those crimes<br />
you heap on me relentlessly, harrowing my heart.<br />
~ (1095--1131)
