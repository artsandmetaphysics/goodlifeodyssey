<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Egyptian priest Manetho grouped the pharaohs into 31 dynasties. Modern Egyptologists tend to count the early, Macedonian, and Ptolemaic pharaohs as three additional dynasties, for a total of 34 dynasties. The dynasties are grouped into the following periods (all dates are BCE and approximate):</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Predynastic (5000--3000), Dynasty 0</li>
<li>Early Dynastic (3000--2625), Dynasties 1--3</li>
<li>Old Kingdom (2625--2130), Dynasties 4--8</li>
<li>First Intermediate Period (2130--1980), Dynasties 9--11</li>
<li>Middle Kingdom (1980--1630), Dynasties 12--14</li>
<li>Second Intermediate Period (1630--1539), Dynasties 15--17</li>
<li>New Kingdom (1539--1075), Dynasties 18--20</li>
<li>Third Intermediate Period (1075--656), Dynasties 21--25</li>
<li>Late Period (664--332), Dynasties 26--31</li>
<li>Hellenistic Period (332--30), Dynasties 32--33</li>
</ol>
<h2>Hieroglyphic</h2>
<p>Egyptian writing first appeared shortly before 3200 BCE. Throughout it's long history it changed a great deal and also had geographical dialects. Hieroglyphic is a means of writing the Egyptian language; it was normally used for more permanent writing. A cursive script, known as hieratic, was used for nearly as long as hieroglyphic as a form of everyday writing. Each hieratic sign has a hieroglyphic counterpart, although the relationship is not always clear.</p>
<p>There are about 500 basic signs.</p>
<h2>Wisdom Literature</h2>
<p>Here are a few excerpts from the Toby Wilkinson translation of the <em>Teaching of Ptahhotep,</em> generally believed to have been composed in the first half of the Twelfth Dynasty (c. 1850):</p>
<blockquote><p>
If you come across a disputatious man in the heat of the moment,<br />
who has authority over you as a superior,<br />
bend your arms in respect and bow.<br />
For if you vex him, he will not be friendly to you.<br />
Diminish his bad speech<br />
by not opposing him while he is in the heat of the moment.<br />
He will be called an ignoramus<br />
while your self-control will equal his wealth.
</p></blockquote>
