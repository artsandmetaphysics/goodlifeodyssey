<p>It’s a Friday evening,<br />
dinner’s not yet started.<br />
<br />
Elanor is grinning,<br />
prancing. Now she’s stacking<br />
wooden blocks, painted red,<br />
purple, pink and yellow,<br />
green and robin-egg blue.<br />
<br />
Some make dominoes, while<br />
others we spin and roll.<br />
Wobbling, wobbling, wobbling—<br />
they end with a crescendo.<br />
<br />
“Mama”, “dada”, “uh-oh”—<br />
little words that echo<br />
through this small apartment,<br />
along with pronouncements<br />
only parents could decipher.<br />
<br />
Next we scribble on New<br />
Yorkers, coloring in<br />
cartoons and white corners.<br />
<br />
Then our one-year-old gets<br />
jealous of the pen I’m<br />
writing poems with. “No no.”<br />
Crayons scatter. Blocks bang.<br />
Dinner preparations<br />
begin and play time ends.</p>
