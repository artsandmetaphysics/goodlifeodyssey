<p>Dijon:: I’ve been reading a book from the eighties—our grandpa read
it and liked it enough to mail copies to all his children, including our
dad. It’s satisfying, thought-provoking, and eerily relevant.</p>
<p>Aaron:: What is it about?</p>
<p>Dijon:: It’s about the causes and effects of moral relativism in
America and, in particular, in our universities. I’ve been pondering a
passage in the introduction for a couple of days during my evening walks
in the park with Elanor. Consider this question: If you know
Christianity is true, wouldn’t you want it established by congress as
the state religion?</p>
<p>Aaron:: No—even if <em>you</em> know it’s true, other citizens may
disagree.</p>
<p>Dijon:: But they’d be mistaken, right? Some kooks believe the
moon-landing was made up, but that doesn’t mean our textbooks should
equivocate on the matter.</p>
<p>Aaron:: Sure. There are always suspicious and uneducated people with
their opinions. But religion is more important than some footprints on
the moon.</p>
<p>Dijon:: If it’s more important, wouldn’t that also make it more
important to establish?</p>
<p>Aaron:: Even if I’m sure that Christianity is true, I wouldn’t want
to force it on others. God wants true believers. I couldn’t prove my
faith to you.</p>
<p>Dijon:: If you can’t prove your faith to me, how do <em>you</em> know
it’s true?</p>
<p>Aaron:: Outside of the narrow world of mathematics and logic, few
things can be <em>proven</em>. You have to weigh arguments, historical
evidence, and your experiences. And for many people, including myself,
faith hangs on internal experience—I’ve felt God’s presence. Once the
arguments have been used up, there’s not much more I can do. I can’t
explain my inner feelings with words—the best I can do is shower you
with love.</p>
<p>Dijon:: Then it’s even more important to establish Christianity as
the state religion! Your privileged knowledge can save others. I
understand that God doesn’t want cultural Christians paying lip service,
but a Christian government could retain some freedom of religion. Don’t
persecute Buddhists or Muslims. Just give Christians some help: give
churches stipends for missionaries, require Bible reading in the
schools, and don’t let movie directors misrepresent your beliefs. You
can’t force someone to have faith, but you can certainly make it easier
for people to believe by keeping it mainstream.</p>
<p>Aaron:: A moderate Christian state may be appealing, but once in
power, the Christian leaders would inevitably fall into sin. They may
rule beneficently for a while, but if their power was justified with
religious beliefs, before long, they’d persecute non-believers to
preserve their power.</p>
<p>Dijon:: You’re probably right, but it could be worthwhile if you
could save enough souls before it fell apart. Medieval Europeans didn’t
enjoy natural rights, but think of all the peasants that were saved!
Christianity has been waning since the Enlightenment gave us liberty and
equality. Maybe it was a poor trade?</p>
<p>Aaron:: Christianity may be waning in the west, but it’s growing in
China and Africa. Clearly God’s kingdom can thrive even in many
situations. Besides, Americans won’t give up their religious freedom
now.</p>
<p>Dijon:: That’s irrelevant. I’m not suggesting that Christians try to
take power. What I want to understand is whether a Christian should
<em>want</em> to have a Christian state.</p>
<p>Aaron:: It’s not irrelevant. Only a lover of thoughts would consider
such a hypothetical situation. A lover of action must focus on the
present situation—how to spread the faith in our current country. You
can’t alter the stars, which are set by God.</p>
<p>Dijon:: I was hoping for conversational indulgences. I’d really like
to know what you think, even if the question seems irrelevant.</p>
<p>Aaron:: Okay, I’ll continue: Christianity isn’t homogeneous. I know
Jesus died for my sins, but I’m much less confident that infants need to
be baptized. Who would regulate these smaller disagreements?</p>
<p>Dijon:: Good point! The first amendment was written more so to
protect Puritans from Anglicans than Buddhists from Christians. A glance
at European history will tell us that regulating these finer
distinctions is hard. But if we throw our hands up in despair, won’t we
have relegated religion to the “realm of opinion,” and all morality
along with it?</p>
<p>Aaron:: Not necessarily. There is an absolute moral standard, but
it’s only partially revealed. The Bible isn’t comprehensive and only
rarely explicit. Similarly, there is one true religion, but it’s not
entirely clear which one.</p>
<p>Dijon:: I thought you said you <em>know</em> Christianity is
true?</p>
<p>Aaron:: I do, but I’m not confident enough to establish it as the
state religion.</p>
<p>Dijon:: You only need to be more confidant than the alternatives. Act
proportionally to reason! Do you have stronger faith in our Constitution
than in Christianity?</p>
<p>Aaron:: This is a false dilemma! You’re oversimplifying.</p>
<p>Dijon:: I’m sorry, Elanor woke up, so I better go!</p>
<p>Aaron:: Enjoy your Sunday!</p>
