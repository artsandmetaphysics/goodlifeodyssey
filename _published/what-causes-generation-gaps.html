<p>Strepsiades, in Aristophanes’ comedy <em>The Clouds</em>, sends his
thriftless son Pheidippedes to the bumbling Socrates’ “thinkery” so he
can learn to argue his way out of the family debts. Only, the son learns
to argue too well:</p>
<blockquote><p>
STREPSIADES: I’ll explain, right from the start, how the quarrel began.
You know we were having a big feast. Well, I asked [my son Phidippides]
to take his lyre and sing a song by Simonides, “The Shearing of Mr.
Ram.” And straight away he says, “That’s so antiquated, that is—playing
the lyre and singing at a drinking party—what do you think we are, women
grinding corn?”
</p></blockquote>

<p>Although comedians exaggerate, we know that a generational gap was
present in Athens at the time. The strife in this scene originates from
shifting artistic taste but ends in a discussion of virtues. The father
says “I raised you as a baby,” and the son says “reason, not age, should
guide our actions” (although absurd reasons are used in the play).</p>
<p>I can relate to the scene. My wife’s parents prefer older movies,
with the actors they know and love, which espouse their Christian
values. During our visits, we would watch a movie each night. After
several nights I tire of the plowing pace and predictable plots of the
older movies. One time, we suggested watching the first episode of one
of our favorite shows—a popular action fantasy. We had forgotten about
the loose morality of the characters. My wife’s parent’s horror grew
until the end of the episode, when (coincidentally) a brother and sister
were caught sleeping with one another! Fortunately, no verbal or
physical fight followed.</p>
<p>It seems that generational gaps form in rapidly changing societies
since the younger generation grows in a different environment than their
parents, and the parents, as all humans do, tend to prefer what they are
used to.</p>
<p>If this is true, we may expect less generational strife in static
societies, like ancient Egypt (where the art, technology, and politics
were uniform for centuries). In societies with a lot of change, like
classical Athens, or modern society with our rapid technological change,
we expect more generational strife.</p>
