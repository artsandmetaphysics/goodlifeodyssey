<h2>Background</h2>
<p><em>The Master and Margarita</em> was written by Mikhail Bulgakov (mee-ha-EEL bool-GA-kov).  He finished writing it in 1940 and it was first published in 1966.</p>
<h2>Thoughts</h2>
<p>I enjoyed reading <em>The Master and Margarita</em> because it was funny, fantastical, and unique.  The novel felt disjointed until the ending, when somehow, it felt like it congealed.  A primary theme is belief in the supernatural.</p>
<p>I noticed many Christian and Fäuste references, and certainly there are many that I missed.  As an American reader who is ignorant of Russian history, I must have also missed other themes and satire.</p>
<h2>Characters</h2>
<p><strong>Mikhail Alexandrovich Berlioz</strong> is the short, dark-haired, plump, bald editor of a literary journal and chairman of the board of Massolit.</p>
<p><strong>Ivan Nikolaevich Ponyrev</strong> is a young, broad-shouldered poet who writes under the pseudonym Homeless.</p>
<p><strong>Koroviev</strong>, also called Fagott, is Woland’s henchman; seven feet tall and unbelievably thin, he has a jeering face.</p>
<p><strong>Woland</strong> is satan. His left teeth have platinum crowns, his right have gold, his right eye is black, his left green, he has dark hair and appears to be a little over 40.</p>
<p><strong>Yeshua Ha-Nozri</strong>, Woland’s depiction of Jesus.  Yeshua is Aramaic for “Lord of Salvation” and Ha-Nozri means “of Nazareth.”</p>
<p><strong>Pontius Pilate</strong> was the procurator of Jerusalem.</p>
<p><strong>Behemoth</strong> is a giant, walking, talking black cat who loves guns and alcohol.  He is one Woland’s companions.</p>
<p><strong>Stepan Bogdanovich Likhodeev</strong>, or Styopa for short, is the director of the Variety Theatre, and Berlioz’s roommate.</p>
<p><strong>Azazello</strong> is one of Woland’s companions; he is short but extraordinarily broad-shouldered; he wears a bowler hat, has flaming red hair, a fang, and is quite ugly.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor Stravinksy</strong> is the friendly psychiatrist at the country hospital.</p>
<p><strong>Nikanor Ivanovich Bosoy</strong> is the chairman of the tenants’ association where Berlioz and Styopa lived.</p>
<p><strong>Grigory Danilovich Rimsky</strong> is the financial directory (findirector) of the Variety Theater.</p>
<p><strong>Ivan Savelyevich Varenukha</strong> is the administrator of the Variety Theater.</p>
<p><strong>Georges Bengalsky</strong> is the master of ceremonies for the Variety Theater.</p>
<p><strong>Vassily Stepanovich Lastochkin</strong> is the bookkeeper at the Variety Theater.</p>
<p><strong>The Master</strong> is a writer, who wrote a book about Pontius Pilate and subsequently went insane.  At the time when Ivan meets him, he is a “clean shaven, dark-haired man of approximately thirty-eight, with a sharp nose, anxious [brown] eyes, and a wisp of hair hanging down on his forehead.”</p>
<p><strong>Margarita Nikolaevna</strong> is a beautiful intelligent woman who lives in Moscow, and is one of the few characters who can accept the supernatural. For this reason Woland and his henchman seem to admire her.</p>
<p>Woland, Homeless, Pontius Pilate, and Margarita were my favourite characters.</p>

<h2>Theme: Belief in the Supernatural</h2>
<p>Satan visits Moscow and accomplishes his plans with many supernatural feats. The book explores how individuals react to these events, and in particular the nature of denial and belief.</p>
<p>The opening discussion, between the editor Berlioz, the poet Ivan, and the Satan, is regarding the existence of Jesus.  After some back and forth, Satan says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
“Bear in mind that Jesus did exist.”<br />
“You see, Professor,” Berlioz responded with a forced smile, “we respect
your great learning, but on this question we hold to a different point
of view.”<br />
“There’s no need for any points of view,” the strange professor replied,
“he simply existed, that’s all.”<br />
“But there’s need for some proof …” Berlioz began.<br />
“There’s no need for any proofs,” replied the professor, and he began to
speak softly …”<br />
= (p. 14)
</p></blockquote>

<p>And then Satan tells the story of Jesus’ trial before Pilate.</p>
<p>Later, Ivan discusses is in the insane asylum discussing his encounter with Satan with another inmate:</p>
<blockquote><p>
“Very well,” the visitor replied, and he said weightily and distinctly:
“Yesterday at the Patriarch’s Ponds you met Satan.”<br />
Ivan did not get upset, as he had promised, but even so he was greatly
astounded.<br />
“That can’t be! He doesn’t exist!”<br />
“Good heavens! Anyone else might say that, but not you. You were
apparently one of his first victims. You’re sitting, as you yourself
understand, in a psychiatric clinic, yet you keep saying he doesn’t
exist. Really, it’s strange!”<br />
“… And, really, I’m surprised at Berlioz! Now you, of course, are a
virginal person,” here the guest apologized again, “but that one, from
what I’ve heard about him, had after all read at least something!”<br />
= (p. 133)
</p></blockquote>

<p>Surprisingly, the visitor (who, unknown to Ivan, is the master) doubts the existence of Satan towards the end of the novel, after Satan has returned the master and Margarita back to their little apartment in Moscow:</p>
<blockquote><p>
“Pah, the devil!” exclaimed the master unexpectedly. “But, just think,
it’s …” he put out his cigarette butt in the ashtray and pressed his
head with his hands. “No, listen, you’re an intelligent person and have
never been crazy … are you seriously convinced that we were at Satan’s
yesterday?”<br />
“Quite seriously,” Margarita replied.<br />
“Of course, of course,” the master said ironically, “so now instead of
one madman there are two—husband and wife!”<br />
= (p. 365)
</p></blockquote>

<p>Margarita, from the start, had less trouble believing in the supernatural, and she tries to convince here lover to believe too:</p>
<blockquote><p>
“I swear to you by your life, I swear by the astrologer’s son whom you
guessed, that all will be well!”<br />
“Fine, fine,” responded the master, and he added, laughing: “of course,
when people have been robbed of everything, like you and me, they seek
salvation from other-worldly powers! Well, so, I agree to seek
there.”<br />
= (p. 367)
</p></blockquote>

<p>But he is still skeptical, until moments later one of Woland’s companions visits:</p>
<blockquote><p>
“No, Margarita’s right… Of course, this is the devil’s messenger sitting
before me. No more than two nights ago, I myself tried to prove to Ivan
that it was precisely Satan whom he had met at the Patriarch’s Ponds,
and now for some reason I got scared of the thoughts and started
babbling something about hypnotists and hallucination…Devil there’s any
hypnotists in it!…”<br />
= (p. 368)
</p></blockquote>

<p>Many other characters struggle to reconcile the supernatural events with their reason.  The findirector Rimsky, upon receiving telegrams from Styopa who had been in Moscow that morning but was transported by Satan across Russian to Yalta, searches for possible explanations:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The findirector’s position was very difficult. It was necessary at once,
right on the spot, to invent ordinary explanations for extraordinary
phenomena.
</p></blockquote>

<p>And later that evening, during Woland’s first séance, the master of ceremonies expresses a common response to the supernatural:</p>
<blockquote><p>
“… And so, now comes the famous foreign artiste, Monseiur Woland, with a
séance of black magic. Well, both you and I know,” here Bengalsky smiled
a wise smile, “that there’s no such thing in the world, and that it’s
all just superstition, and Maestro Woland is simply a perfect master of
the technique of conjuring, as we shall see from the most interesting
part, that is, the exposure of the technique”<br />
= (p. 119)
</p></blockquote>

<p>and, after a couple very impressive “magic tricks,” including a rain of cash from the ceiling:</p>
<blockquote><p>
“Here, citizens, you and I have just beheld a case of so-called mass
hypnosis. A purely scientific experiment, proving in the best way
possible that there are no miracles in magic. Let us ask Maestro Woland
to expose this experiment for us. Presently, citizens, you will see
these supposed banknotes disappear as suddenly as they appeared.”<br />
Here he applauded, but quite alone, while a confident smile played on
his face, yet in his eyes there was no such confidence, but rather an
expression of entreaty.<br />
= (p. 122)
</p></blockquote>

<p>Shortly after, Satan has his cat cut off Bengalsky’s head (it is put back on later) and then Bengalsky ends up in the insane asylum with other characters who have run into Wooland.</p>
<p>Perhaps the novel’s most direct rejection of atheism and disbelief is found in Woland’s last words to the beheaded atheist Berlioz at his ball:</p>
<blockquote><p>
“Everything came to pass, did it not?” Woland went on, looking into the
head’s eyes. “The head was cut off by a woman, the meeting did not take
place, and I am living in your apartment. That is a fact. And fact is
the most stubborn thing in the world. But we are now interested in what
follows, and not in this already accomplished fact. You have always been
an ardent preacher of the theory that, on the cutting off of his head,
life ceases in a man, he turns to ashes and goes into non-being. I have
the pleasure of informing you, in the presence of my guests, though they
serve as proof of quite a different theory, that your theory is both
solid and clever. However, one theory is as good as another. There is
also one which holds that it will be given to each according to his
faith. Let it come true! You go into non-being, and from the cup into
which you are to be transformed, I will joyfully drink to being!”<br />
= (p. 273)
</p></blockquote>

<p>The epilogue describes how the many people who saw Woland’s supernatural séance were able to rationalize it away and subsequently forget about it.</p>
<p>Thus, from start to finish, the novel explores belief and disbelief in reaction to the devil.  The devil, like Jesus in the Bible, wants people to believe in him.</p>
<h2>Quotes</h2>
<p>A nice taste of Bulgakov’s funny whimsical style is found near the beginning of the novel, when two writers in the park attempt to a seltzer:</p>
<blockquote><p>
“Give us seltzer,” Berlioz asked.<br />
“There is no seltzer,” the woman in the stand said, and for some reason
became offended.<br />
“Is there beer?” Homeless inquired in a rasping voice.<br />
“Beer’ll be delivered towards evening,” the woman replied.<br />
“Then what is there?” asked Berlioz.<br />
“Apricot soda, only warm,” said the woman.<br />
“Well, let’s have it, let’s have it! …”<br />
The soda produced an abundance of yellow foam, and the air began to
smell of a barber-shop. Having finished drinking, the writers
immediately started to hiccup, paid, and sat down on a bench face to the
pond and back to Bronnaya.<br />
= (p. 3)
</p></blockquote>

<p>This quote, which has stuck with me perhaps more than any other, appears to be Bulgakov’s rejection of human-derived morality:</p>
<blockquote><p>
“But here is a question that is troubling me: if there is no God, then,
one may ask, who governs human life and, in general, the whole order of
things on earth?”<br />
“Man governs it himself,’ Homeless angrily hastened to reply to this
admittedly none-too-clear question.<br />
“Pardon me,” the stranger responded gently, “but in order to govern, one
needs, after all, to have a precise plan for a certain, at least
somewhat decent, length of time. Allow me to ask you, then how can man
govern, if he is not only deprived of the opportunity of making a plan
for at least some ridiculously short period—well, say, a thousand
years—but cannot even vouch for his own tomorrow?”<br />
= (pp. 9 - 10)
</p></blockquote>

<p>And to make his point, the stranger predicts that Berlioz will die shortly there after, and sure enough he does.  And, as we saw earlier, Berlioz meets an unfortunate ending.</p>
<p>The foreigner describes the process of getting lung-cancer:</p>
<blockquote><p>
“You are no longer interested in anyone’s fate but your own. Your family
starts lying to you. Feeling that something is wrong, you rush to
learned doctors, then to quacks, and sometimes to fortune-tellers as
well. Like the first, so the second and third are completely senseless,
as you understand. And it all ends tragically: a man who still recently
thought he was governing something, suddenly winds up lying motionless
in a wooden box, and the people around him, seeing that the man lying
there is no longer good for anything, burn him in an oven.”<br />
= (p. 10)
</p></blockquote>

<p>Yeshua, explaining to Pontius Pilate that he did not incite the Jews to destroy the temple:</p>
<blockquote><p>
“These good people … haven’t any learning and have confused everything I
told them. Generally, I’m beginning to be afraid that this confusion may
go on for a very long time. And all because he writes down the things I
say incorrectly.”<br />
= (p. 19)
</p></blockquote>

<p>Bulgakov’s interpolation of John 18:38, when Pilate asks Jesus “What is Truth?”:</p>
<blockquote><p>
“And why did you stir up the people in the bazaar, you vagrant, talking
about the truth, of which you have no notion? What is truth?”<br />
And here the procurator thought: “Oh, my gods! I’m asking him about
something unnecessary at a trial … my reason no longer serves me …” And
again he pictured a cup of dark liquid. “Poison, bring me poison…”<br />
And again he heard the voice:<br />
“The truth is, first of all, that your head aches, and aches so badly
that you’re having faint-hearted thoughts of death. You’re not only
unable to speak to me, but it is even hard for you to look at me. And I
am now your unwilling torturer, which upsets me. You can’t even think
about anything and only dream that your dog should come, apparently the
one being you are attached to. But your suffering will soon be over,
your headache will go away.”<br />
= (p. 21)
</p></blockquote>

<p>Bulgakov’s disdain for the mystics:</p>
<blockquote><p>
But no, no! The seductive mystics are lying, there are no Caribbean Seas
in the world, no desperate freebooters sail them, no corvette chases
after them, no cannon smoke drifts across the waves. There is nothing,
and there was nothing! There is that sickly linden over there, there is
the cast-iron fence, and the boulevard beyond it … And the ice is
melting in the bowl, and at the next table you see someone’s bloodshot,
bovine eyes, and you’re afraid, afraid … Oh, gods, my gods, poison,
bring me poison! …<br />
= (p. 58)
</p></blockquote>

<p>Bulgakov’s describes how Berlioz’s death is received:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Yes, he’s dead, dead … But, we, we’re alive!<br />
Yes, a wave of grief billowed up, held out for a while, but then began
to subside, and somebody went back to his table and—sneakily at first,
then openly—drank a little vodka and ate a bite. And, really, can one
let chicken cutlets de volaille perish? How can we help Mikhail
Alexandrovich? By going hungry? But, after all, we’re alive!<br />
= (p. 59)
</p></blockquote>

<p>The various schemes to get Berlioz’s living space:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The news of Berlioz’s death spread through the whole house with a sort
of supernatural speed, and as of seven o’clock Thursday morning, Bosoy
began to receive telephone calls and then personal visits with
declarations containing claims to the deceased’s living space. In the
period of two hours, Nikanor Ivanovich received thirty-two such
declarations.<br />
They contained pleas, threats, libels, denunciations, promises to do
renovations at their expense, references to unbearable over-crowding and
the impossibility of living in the same apartment with bandits. Among
others there were a description, staggering in its artistic power, of
the theft from the apartment no. 31 of some meat dumplings, tucked
directly into the pocket of a suit jacket, two vows to end life by
suicide and one confession of secret pregnancy.<br />
= (p. 92)
</p></blockquote>

<p>How to tell if someone is lying:</p>
<blockquote><p>
“Understand that the tongue can conceal the truth, but the eyes—never! A
sudden question is put to you, you don’t even flinch, in one second you
get hold of yourself and know what you must say to conceal the truth,
and you speak quite convincingly, and not a wrinkle on your face moves,
but—alas—the truth which the question stirs up from the bottom of your
soul leaps momentarily into your eyes, and it’s all over! They see it,
and you’re caught!”<br />
= (p. 165)
</p></blockquote>

<p>A lament as the master and Margarita leave the earth:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Gods, my gods! How sad the evening earth! How mysterious the mists over
the swamps! He who has wandered in these mists, he who has suffered much
before death, he who has flown over this earth bearing on himself too
heavy a burden, knows it. The weary man knows it. And without regret he
leaves the mists of the earth, its swamps and rivers, with a light heart
he gives himeself into the hands of death, knowing that she alone can
bring him peace.<br />
= (p. 379)
</p></blockquote>
