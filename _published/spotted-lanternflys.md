<p>I first saw a Spotted Lanternfly earlier in the summer. I was with my wife in a playground on the edge of the park. “Jackson’s mom said we should kill them—they’re an invasive species.” The bugs have red wings with black spots. I think they’re pretty. It’s too bad that they’re invasive, and that there are so many. Apparently, they kill fruit trees.</p>
<p>Since then, I’ve stomped another hundred Lanternflies. I see them everywhere. I thought I saw one fluttering outside during a client presentation twelve floors up in a building near the east river.</p>
<p>I often see them near the big metal columns outside my office when I’m entering in the morning. When I do, I try to stomp them. I usually succeed, but sometimes they’re too quick and they jump away. They don’t go too far, so I’ll usually make a second attempt. Sometimes, when they escape, they land by another lanterfly, and so I’ll stomp them both. I must look funny stomping around in the morning with my leather shoes. I wonder if the nearby New Yorkers know that the state has asked us to kill these bugs.</p>
<p>I saw a lanternfly in the public space outside my office when I was returning from lunch. I missed, and the lanternfly jumped and landed on the white shirt collar of an old bald man with sunspots! He somehow didn’t notice it, and kept staring out across 48th street. I panicked for a split second, and then decided to go through the revolving doors back into the office.</p>
