<p>The Euthyphro dilemma, named after Plato’s dialogue where it is first described, asks: do the gods love good action because it is good, or is good action good because it is loved by the gods? A Christian may ask a similar question: does God love righteous behavior because it is good, or is righteous behavior good because God dictates it?</p>
<p>There is another question that may shed light on how a Christian may answer the Euthyphro dilemma: Why did God need to send his only son Jesus to die on the cross? Why couldn’t he, being God, simply forgive our sins without doing this? A common answer is that God needed to send Jesus to be both merciful and just when he condemns but forgives sinful humans. If so, then God is beheld to an external moral standard of justice. Thus, it seems these two beliefs are inconsistent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Righteous behavior is good because God dictates it to be so.</li>
<li>God needed to send Jesus to die to be both merciful and just when he condemns yet forgives sinful humans.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some may opt out of the second belief, and say God didn't <em>need</em> to send Jesus to be both merciful and just, but rather, he merely wanted to do so. This may be true, but then we are still left wondering why.</p>
