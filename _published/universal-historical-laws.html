<p>Some philosophers think history is uninteresting because it can not
provide laws, or law-like explanations, and thus its inferences can’t be
rationally evaluated.</p>
<p>I agree that the historian, like the social scientist, can’t produce
laws. By law I mean a universally true, conditional statement about
reality. (Defining a law to be a <em>conditional</em> statement
distinguishes it from particular statements like “Julius Caesar was
murdered on the 15th of March, 44 BC.”) The objects of historical
study—people, nations, wars, governments, etc.—are too complex to
define, let alone deduce universally true conditional statements
about.</p>
<p>Even if one agrees that the historian can’t discover universal laws,
one may believe they exist. I hope to demonstrate that historical
laws—laws pertaining to historical subjects—as distinct from scientific
laws, can’t exist. Furthermore I will show that, despite this epistemic
limitation, history remains useful and open to rational evaluation.</p>
<p>Consider this statement: When a ruling power’s dominance is
threatened by a growing neighbor, the two will go to war. This simple
historical statement isn’t universally true and is thus not a law; there
are instances of nations peacefully eclipsing their once-dominant
neighbors. It may be made into a law by amending conditions. For
example, one may add “when the existing nation isn’t distracted by other
wars” to account for certain exceptions. It may be possible, after
adding three or four such conditions, to make the law fit all available
historical examples. Yet there is no reason to believe it is now
universally true.</p>
<p>Historical events may be driven by individuals, thus historical laws
must predict the individual’s behavior. To see why this is true,
consider the following examples. A nation may war with a smaller
neighbor as the result of a few neurotransmitters in their supreme
leader’s brain. Or two nuclear powers may avoid war only because of the
calm reasoning of a missile operator. These examples are extreme, but to
be universally true, a historical law must account for them.</p>
<p>One may understand Words of languages, are complex patterns formed by
particles in time and space. Water molecules are well-defined pattern. A
cup is less well-defined, yet more so than a person. The concept of a
nation, or a war, are patterns built on patterns, layered recursively
like the definitions in a dictionary. Words compress the overwhelming
detail needed for complete descriptions, allowing our minds to operate
in reality at a higher level of abstraction.</p>
<p>The compressive and lossy nature of words precludes the existence of
historical laws. Said another way, any law whose objects are imprecise
patterns of particles will fail to be true in every instance; since the
words used to state the law have already blurred out the details
necessary to make conclusive predictions.</p>
<p>To avoid this conclusion one must identify larger objects whose
behavior could be predicted with certainty without knowledge of their
constituent particles. We refer to such a system as a <em>black
box</em>. The laws of physics preclude the existence of black boxes.</p>
<p>There are, however, systems that can be described as statistical
black boxes. For example, we may explain and predict the some behavior
of a glass of water using a few of numbers—e.g., its temperature and
volume. Humans, however, certainly can not be reduced to such simple
system! Without being pulled into questions of freewill and determinism,
we can conclude that to predict human behavior with the precision
required by a universally true law, we would need detailed knowledge of
the particles constituting that human.</p>
<p>Consider again our example, “when a ruling power’s dominance is
threatened by a growing neighbor, they will go to war.” Now imagine that
God were to try and make it true by reviewing all possible wars and
amending the statement with conditionals as needed. After considering
every possible war, the amended law would be enormous and would account
for neurotransmitters and other physical details. Such a law could not
be understood by the human mind. In fact, I believe such a law would
need to contain even the physical laws of nature to be universally
true!</p>
<p>Thus, we must abandon any belief in the existence of historical laws,
and can consider whether laws, or law-like explanations, are necessary
for something to be rationally evaluated.</p>
<p>I don’t believe laws are necessary for historical analysis to be
rationally evaluated. I will demonstrate this indirectly, by showing
that if such a statement were true, rationality and philosophy would
need to relegated to the realms of science.</p>
<p>Business books are a practical, and widely used, form of historical
knowledge. The conclusions of such books are not universally true (and
many are simply incorrect), yet collectively they are not useless.
Otherwise, business people would not continue making decisions based on
them. Likewise, governments and militaries rely heavily on historical
analysis.</p>
<p>If one defines “rationally evaluable” so as to preclude these uses of
historical knowledge in business, government, and the military, it would
seem that the realm of philosophy is inappropriately reduced. The desire
for the level of precision found in mathematics and the hard sciences is
understandable, but by relegating oneself to these tidier fields of
inquiry the philosopher avoids the big questions—of people, values,
governments, and war—which are most interesting.</p>
<p>(In addition to producing generalized knowledge, the particulars of
history form the identity of nations and peoples. Thus, some historical
knowledge is necessary to understand human behavior and to appreciate
the beauty of our literature and art.)</p>
<p>The claim investigated in this essay is not unlike the one, made by
some philosophers, that only statements verifiable through direct
observation or logical proof are meaningful. It is tempting to make such
claims when confronting the messy nature of reality and language, but
doing so erodes credibility when our everyday reality continually
provides evidence of the utility and interest of history.</p>
<p>The philosopher must settle with sketches, observations, heuristics,
and other weaker epistemological devices that history provides, while
continuing to apply them to the large questions of human existence.</p>
