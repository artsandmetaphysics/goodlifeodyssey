<blockquote><p>
A baby is born and the parents love the baby.<br />
A baby is born and the parents raise the baby.<br />
A baby is born and the parents teach it words.<br />
The words come slowly.<br />
The words grow longer<br />
And the words grow clearer.<br />
The child is taught to act.<br />
The acts of the child are bad.<br />
The child is taught discipline.<br />
The child grows into a person.<br />
And this person lives how they please.<br />
Pleasures and pursuits fill its time.<br />
<br />
Life’s pain encroaches.<br />
<br />
The person looks for meaning<br />
And the person searches for purpose<br />
And the person asks how to live.<br />
Religion tells this person how to live.<br />
Religion tells this person what exists<br />
What exists but is not seen.<br />
<br />
How do they know?<br />
How do they trust the words of the ancient books,<br />
The words passed down through the ages<br />
The words of the prophets<br />
The words of the priests?<br />
<br />
I want to act well.<br />
I want to not do what I should not do<br />
And do what I should do.<br />
<br />
The words of the priests tell me what to do!<br />
The prophets speak out!<br />
The ancient books pass along their wisdom.<br />
But how can I trust their knowledge?<br />
How can I know?
</p></blockquote>
