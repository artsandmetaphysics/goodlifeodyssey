<p>Socrates:: Is it, then, the part of a just man to harm any human
being whatsoever?</p>
<p>Polemarchus:: Certainly, bad men and enemies ought to be harmed.</p>
<p>Socrates:: Do horses that have been harmed become better or
worse?</p>
<p>Polemarchus:: Worse.</p>
<p>Socrates:: With respect to the <em>aretē</em> of dogs or to that of
horses?</p>
<p>Polemarchus:: With respect to that of horses.</p>
<p>Socrates:: And when dogs are harmed, do they become worse with
respect to the <em>aretē</em> of dogs and not to that of horses?</p>
<p>Polemarchus:: Necessarily.</p>
<p>Socrates:: Should we not assert the same of human beings, my
comrade---that when they are harmed, they become worse with respect to
human <em>aretē</em>?</p>
<p>Polemarchus:: Most certainly.</p>
<p>Socrates:: But isn't justice human <em>aretē</em>.</p>
<p>Polemarchus:: That's also necessary.</p>
<p>Socrates:: Then, my friend, human beings who have been harmed
necessarily become more unjust.</p>
<p>Polemarchus:: It seems so.</p>
<p>Socrates:: Well, are musicians able to make men unmusical by
music?</p>
<p>Polemarchus:: Impossible.</p>
<p>Socrates:: Are men skilled in horsemanship able to make men
incompetent riders by horsemanship?</p>
<p>Polemarchus:: That can't be.</p>
<p>Socrates:: But are just men to make others unjust by justice, of all
things? Or, in sum, are good men able to make other men bad by
<em>aretē</em>?</p>
<p>Polemarchus:: Impossible.</p>
<p>Socrates:: For I suppose that cooling is not the work of heat, but of
its opposite.</p>
<p>Polemarchus:: Yes.</p>
<p>Socrates:: Nor wetting the work of dryness but of its opposite.</p>
<p>Polemarchus:: Certainly.</p>
<p>Socrates:: Nor is harming, in fact, the work of the good but of its
opposite.</p>
<p>Polemarchus:: It looks like it.</p>
<p>Socrates:: And it's the just man who is good?</p>
<p>Polemarchus:: Certainly.</p>
<p>Socrates:: Then it is not the work of the just man to harm either a
friend or anyone else, Polemarchus, but of his opposite, the unjust
man.</p>
<p>Polemarchus:: In my opinion, Socrates, what you say is entirely
true.</p>
<p>Dijon:: My opinion, Socrates, is not yet formed. Would you be willing
to help me complete it by answering a few questions?</p>
<p>Socrates:: I will try.</p>
<p>Dijon:: Why do you think music and horsemanship can teach us about
justice?</p>
<p>Socrates:: Music is the <em>aretē</em> of musicians, horsemanship the
<em>aretē</em> of men skilled in horsemanship, and justice the
<em>aretē</em> of humans. Thus, if we know a property of music and
horsemanship, we may reason that justice will have the same property,
for all three share the same essential nature as types of
<em>aretē</em>.</p>
<p>Dijon:: Do you agree that music and horsemanship are unique arts?</p>
<p>Socrates:: Certainly.</p>
<p>Dijon:: Couldn't this property, for example that musicians can't make
men unmusical by music, be due to music's unique nature and not its
nature as a type of <em>aretē</em>?</p>
<p>Socrates:: No, because each art follows the same pattern: Can a poet
make men less poetic with poetry?</p>
<p>Dijon:: A masterful poet may make an ambitious young person stop
pursuing their art, fleeing for an easier mountain to climb.</p>
<p>Socrates:: This isn't entirely implausible, but wouldn't this
ambitious young person still love poetry more for having observed the
master's greatness?</p>
<p>Dijon:: Maybe, but is the <em>aretē</em> of poets to listen to poetry
or to write it?</p>
<p>Also, what is the <em>aretē</em> of a warrior? Wouldn't it be to harm
their enemies?</p>
<p>And I have a different question. When you harm a horse, how is its
horse <em>aretē</em> decreased?</p>
<p>Socrates:: I do not know the <em>aretē</em> of horses well, but they
must be able to take their rider long distances quickly---now still, now
galloping like lightning---like the great breed of Tros' team, whom
Diomedes wrested from Aeneas and who won him a slave woman in the great
funeral games of Patroclus. Would even one of these excellent horses,
given by Zeus for Ganymede, have been as excellent if Diomedes' spear
had pierced its leg instead of splitting through Pandarus' jaw?</p>
<p>Dijon:: Indeed not, and so when you speak of human <em>aretē</em>
being decreased by harm, do you mean the same type of harm?</p>
<p>Socrates:: The <em>aretē</em> of men is different than the
<em>aretē</em> of horses, and so men can be harmed by more than spears,
swords, and boulders.</p>
<p>Dijon:: Yet physical harm will make a man worse with respect to human
<em>aretē</em>?</p>
<p>Socrates:: Yes.</p>
<p>Dijon:: And since justice is human <em>aretē</em>, if a man is caught
abusing widows and orphans and is beaten with a plank and whipped, does
this beating with a plank and whipping make the man less just?</p>
<p>Socrates:: It looks like it.</p>
<p>Dijon:: It seems that you are using the word "just" in a different
sense than I usually use the word. Perhaps I am only confused about
this.</p>
<p>Isn't it possible that the man's punishment would lead him to
consider his error, thus making him better with respect to human
<em>aretē</em>? While physical harm may not make horses better, it
doesn't seem to follow that physical harm can't make humans better.
Wouldn't you agree that not <em>all</em> harm is bad?</p>
<p>Socrates:: I do not. Can a punishment, intended to improve the
person, be properly called a harm? When Simonedes says to help your
friends and harm your enemies, he must have meant killing your enemies,
stealing their cattle, and making their wives your slaves.</p>
<p>Dijon:: Consider, then, that the widow and orphan abuser is stoned to
death. Couldn't the stoning, while unable to make the abuser more just,
serve to make others more just by example?</p>
