<p>Eurus:: In our group discussion, you demonstrated that the concept of
a bee is not fundamental; individual bees may be similar, but there is
no inherent bee-essence. One may say, “bee-essence is the ability to
reproduce bees.” However, you showed how gradual evolutionary change
refutes this argument. “Consider an ancient bee that, if alive, could
reproduce with a modern bee. Now consider an even more ancient bee that
can reproduce with the ancient bee but not with the modern bee. Does the
ancient bee have two essences, one to reproduce with the modern bee and
another to reproduce with the more ancient bee?”</p>
<p>Your conceptual deconstructions remind me of śūnyatā, or emptiness, a
tenet of the Madhyamaka Buddhist tradition. Śūnyatā says that nothing
has svabhāva—essence, inherent existence, or true identity.</p>
<p>Dijon:: Thanks for sharing. I’d like to learn more about śūnyatā
because it seems to me that there must be some fundamental things,
perhaps particles, that inherently exist. If this weren’t the case, then
how could anything exist? Said another way, although I think our minds
project the <em>concept of a bee</em> onto an external reality, I still
think there are aggregates of fundamentally existing things which we
call bees.</p>
<p>Eurus:: Before I continue, I should point out that I’m not especially
well-acquainted with Madhyamaka thought, so my comments may not be
precisely correct.</p>
<p>Dijon:: I appreciate that you are willing to engage with me on these
essential questions, even if you aren’t entirely sure of your own
beliefs. Please continue!</p>
<p>Eurus:: Śūnyatā doesn’t say that nothing exists, but only that
nothing has svabhāva—essence, inherent existence, or true identity.
Śūnyatā is closely related to dependent origination, or
pratītyasamutpāda. According to this doctrine, all phenomena arise in
dependence upon other phenomena, which themselves arise in dependence
upon other phenomena. Dependent origination leads to śūnyatā because
phenomena can’t exist independently. Things do exist
<em>conventionally</em>, similar to how Theseus’s ship exists
conventionally. The error is to think that anything exists
in-and-of-itself.</p>
<p>Nāgārjuna, who founded the Madhyamaka Buddhist school, summarizes
this in a famous verse of his <em>Mūlamadhyamakakārikā</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Whatever is dependently co-arisen<br />
That is explained to be emptiness.<br />
That, being a dependent designation<br />
Is itself the middle way.
</p></blockquote>

<p>You say that particles exist in-and-of-themselves. While we can come
up with a scientific theory with constructs like particles or wave
functions at the bottom, I do not believe that science itself supposes
these constructs have svabhāva. This would be true even if we found the
correct theory of everything. For example, it seems tenuous to claim
that wave functions fundamentally exist. To the physicist, a wave
function is a mathematical tool that describes our observations. To say
more is to go beyond what empirical science can support.</p>
<p>Dijon:: I think I’m using the term <em>fundamentally exist</em>
differently than you’re using <em>svabhāva</em>. When I say something
fundamentally exists, I mean it influences reality, and it can’t be
broken into smaller pieces. Accordingly, if a wave function completely
describes the behaviors we observe and can’t be replaced by a simpler
construct, then I would say it fundamentally exists.</p>
<p>Eurus:: What does it mean to say something “influences reality” or
that something “can’t be broken into smaller pieces”? Our discussion
reminds me of a passage in <em>The Feynman Lectures</em> about the
philosophical implications of quantum mechanics that may be helpful.
I’ll read it:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Another thing that people have emphasized since quantum mechanics was
developed is the idea that we should not speak about those things which
we cannot measure. Unless a thing can be defined by measurement, it has
no place in a theory. And since an accurate value of the momentum of a
localized particle cannot be defined by measurement it therefore has no
place in the theory.<br />
The idea that this is what was the matter with classical theory is a
false position. It is a careless analysis of the situation. Just because
we cannot measure position and momentum precisely does not a priori mean
that we cannot talk about them. It only means that we need not talk
about them. The situation in the sciences is this: A concept or an idea
which cannot be measured or cannot be referred directly to experiment
may or may not be useful. It need not exist in a theory. In other words,
suppose we compare the classical theory of the world with the quantum
theory of the world, and suppose that it is true experimentally that we
can measure position and momentum only imprecisely. The question is
whether the ideas of the exact position of a particle and the exact
momentum of a particle are valid or not. The classical theory admits the
ideas; the quantum theory does not. This does not in itself mean that
classical physics is wrong.<br />
When the new quantum mechanics was discovered, the classical
people—which included everybody except Heisenberg, Schrödinger, and
Born—said: “Look, your theory is not any good because you cannot
answer certain questions like: what is the exact position of a
particle?, which hole does it go through?, and some others.”
Heisenberg’s answer was: “I do not need to answer such questions because
you cannot ask such a question experimentally.” It is that we do not
have to. Consider two theories (a) and (b); (a) contains an idea that
cannot be checked directly but which is used in the analysis, and the
other, (b), does not contain the idea. If they disagree in their
predictions, one could not claim that (b) is false because it cannot
explain this idea that is in (a), because that idea is one of the things
that cannot be checked directly.<br />
It is always good to know which ideas cannot be checked directly, but it
is not necessary to remove them all. It is not true that we can pursue
science completely by using only those concepts which are directly
subject to experiment.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Dijon:: The ideas in this passage can indeed improve my definition:
Let’s say something <em>fundamentally exists</em> if it is an
irreducible construct in a theory that explains all our empirical
observations.</p>
<p>Eurus:: Your second definition is better, but what does it mean to be
“irreducible”? Quantum mechanics can be formulated in several different
ways. Are constructs that are only present in some formulation
irreducible? Could such a construct, especially if it can’t be directly
measured, be said to exist in any normal sense of the word? They seem
more like mathematical machinery to me.</p>
<p>Dijon:: Such constructs do <em>feel</em> like mathematical machinery.
But how could it be otherwise? If the universe consists of small and
simple particles and eyes are large and complex aggregates of particles,
then eyes would necessarily not be able to see particles. If we also
assume that the universe is ordered, then particles would follow
mathematical laws and would be indirectly-known mathematical
machinery.</p>
<p>Eurus:: Are you sure an eye <em>necessarily</em> couldn’t see a
single particle? In our universe, human eyes can detect individual
photons.</p>
<p>Dijon:: It can, in special circumstances. However, given that the eye
and the brain require an immense number of particles to detect a single
photon, they couldn’t operate at the scale of the particles. It would be
too much information.</p>
<p>Eurus:: Couldn’t an eye see a focus down on a small number of
particles? I’m not sure I see your point.</p>
<p>Dijon:: It’s not clear to me either, so I’ll give another example:
Imagine a universe consisting of mind as well as particles. Sight is a
fundamental property of mind, thus mind can see particles directly. It
would be as if our vision was pixelated, and the laws of physics
appeared to operate on pixels. Even in this universe, how would minds
know they were seeing the things-in-themselves? How could they know they
hit bottom?</p>
<p>Perhaps the mathematical machinery is the thing-in-itself. The
existence of multiple formulations doesn’t seem to disprove this;
information can always be represented in several ways—certainly, a
grid of pixels can be.</p>
<p>The physicist studying the laws of nature is in the same situation as
the programmer reverse-engineering a software libraries’ interface
without access to the implementation. If the implementation acts in a
consistent way, then with enough effort, we may be able to perfectly
understand and describe the interface. We could predict how it would
work in future situations. However, we would have no way of knowing
anything about the software library besides its observable behavior. We
could hypothesize about how it is implemented—what the particles are
in-and-of-themselves—but we would have no way of validating the
hypotheses.</p>
<p>Therefore, I agree empirical science can’t say anything about the
thing-in-itself. However, if to have svabhāva means something different
than to fundamentally exist, then by definition, it is a property of the
thing-in-itself that is beyond the reach of science.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean there <em>aren’t</em> things-in-themselves below
the mathematical machinery or that svabhāva is a meaningless term. If we
spoke about the sensation of blue to a citizen of a blueless universe,
they wouldn’t know what we mean—but that doesn’t mean blue isn’t a
valid concept. But it does mean we would require divine revelation to
know whether anything has svabhāva. In our software analogy, divine
revelation is like the library’s author telling us unobservable
implementation details.</p>
<p>Eurus:: You make some interesting points. You’ve defined
<em>fundamentally exist</em> to ensure that empirical science can verify
it. I agree, according to this definition, that wave functions
fundamentally exist. I don’t think it follows, however, that wave
functions have svabhāva.</p>
<p>How is svabhāva different than your term <em>fundamentally
exist</em>? The most important difference is that svabhāva is ultimately
an idea about cognition. Ordinary beings misapprehend phenomena as
ultimately real entities, existing in themselves, having svabhāva, as a
result of their delusion—or avidyā. Awakened beings, having exhausted
their delusion, perceive phenomena as they truly are: illusory,
dreamlike, and conceptually fabricated. Liberation is only achieved by
uprooting avidyā, not just by <em>knowing about</em> avidyā. In a sense,
it’s like directly perceiving the thing-in-itself and realizing there’s
nothing there. An analogy commonly used to demonstrate this is that
Buddhist teachings are like a map of a territory. It is necessary to
study the map, but that alone doesn’t get you to the destination. Still,
it is useful to engage in the intellectual analysis because this can
push one to relinquish false views that they may have about reality,
paving the way for new understanding to arise.</p>
<p>What can then be said about svabhāva from a more precise,
metaphysical perspective? Nāgārjuna says at the beginning of chapter 15
of the <em>Mūlamadhyamakakārikā</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Svabhāva cannot reasonably occur<br />
Due to causes and conditions.<br />
Svabhāva that arises due to causes and conditions<br />
Would be svabhāva that is produced.
</p></blockquote>

<p>One way to understand svabhāva is through the idea of
<em>disappearance under analysis</em>. If you analyze the notion of a
chair, the chair disappears and you are left with wooden parts. The
chair is not an ultimately real entity; it doesn’t possess svabhāva.
You, of course, know this, since our conversation began with you making
the notion of a species disappear, but this is only one type of
existential dependence.</p>
<p>The dGe-Lugs tradition identifies three types of existential
dependence: dependence on causes and conditions, dependence on parts,
and dependence on the designating mind. These exist within a hierarchy,
with the dependence of the designating mind being the most subtle and
incorporating all three.</p>
<p>Svabhāva is thus a stronger notion than your term <em>fundamentally
exist</em>, which permits dependence on causes and conditions.</p>
<p>For example, a wave function is different at every point in time.
Therefore the idea of the wave function as a single entity that changes
over time can be decomposed into a sequence of wave function snapshots
in succession, similar to how we decompose a chair into its parts.</p>
<p>Dijon:: If a wave function snapshot fully determines the next
snapshot, then it seems the <em>essence</em> of the wave function is
present in the first snapshot.</p>
<p>Eurus:: This could be true for a simple idealized wave function, but
any real wave function will depend on changing boundary conditions. For
example, a quantum harmonic oscillator may evolve deterministically, but
what maintains the quadratic potential? Unless the entire universe was
just a harmonic oscillator, it <em>would</em> change eventually, and
when it does, there would be existential dependence; you would no longer
be able to predict the wave function’s future state from its current
state, and there would be no essence.</p>
<p>The division between a system and its surroundings is a useful
approximation, but you can’t splice the world like this. This is true
even in classical mechanics, but in quantum mechanics, entanglement even
more strongly prohibits the division, since two particles that are far
apart can affect one another. David Bohm describes this nicely in one of
his papers:</p>
<blockquote><p>
A quantum many-body system cannot properly be analyzed into
independently existent parts, with fixed and determinate dynamical
relationships between each of the parts. Rather, the “parts” are seen to
be in an immediate connection, in which their dynamical relationships
depend, in an irreducible way, on the state of the whole system (and
indeed on that of broader systems in which they are contained, extending
ultimately and in principle to the entire universe). Thus, one is led to
a new notion of unbroken wholeness which denies the classical idea of
analyzability of the world into separately and independently existent
parts.
</p></blockquote>

<p>As you know, Bohm’s interpretation of quantum mechanics is one of a
few. However, I think this point is valid in all interpretations.</p>
<p>Dijon:: I think you’re correct. Let me read a quote from Sean
Carroll:</p>
<blockquote><p>
A feature that is common to all interpretations of quantum mechanics is
that what we see when we look at the world is quite different from how
we describe the world when we’re not looking at it. In a sense it is the
ultimate unification: not only does the deepest layer of reality not
consist of things like “oceans” and “mountains”; it doesn’t even consist
of things like “electrons” and “photons.” It’s just the quantum wave
function. Everything else is a convenient way of talking.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Therefore, I was mistaken when I said “perhaps particles” are the
fundamentally existing building blocks of reality. Electrons, like bees,
are a conceptual projection onto the universe’s wave function.</p>
<p>In another place, Carroll says the wave function may evolve
deterministically. If this is the case, then would you say that the wave
function of the universe has svabhāva?</p>
<p>Eurus:: If the universe was only a single deterministic wave
function, I think it would <em>fundamentally exist</em> and potentially
have svabhāva. But I disagree with the premise. It’s unfathomable to me
that consciousness and volition could exist in such a universe.
Therefore, I think the non-deterministic interpretations of quantum
mechanics are correct. After all, they are all interpretations; no
objective evidence can be used to distinguish them.</p>
<p>Dijon:: Even if we accept a non-deterministic interpretation, the
laws of physics themselves are static. Perhaps this provides the wave
function essence?</p>
<p>Eurus:: I don’t think so. It’s incoherent to speak of the laws of
physics in isolation. Imagine there was no physical universe—perhaps
all that existed were a set of minds in a formless realm. In what sense
could you say that the laws of physics exist? Without physical phenomena
that evolve in accordance with the laws of physics, the laws of physics
have no meaning. They can’t stand alone; they only exist as properties
of physical phenomena, and in that sense they depend on physical
phenomena for their existence. Like particles and bees, they disappear
under analysis. When you analyze the essence of the laws of physics,
you’re left with nothing but physical phenomena evolving as described by
those laws.</p>
<p>Dijon:: I see, if the laws of physics are a description, then they
can’t give the wave function an essence. What if the wave function
behaves a certain, fixed way, and the way it behaves is the essence?</p>
<p>Eurus:: I’ll have to consider this argument further.</p>
<p>We’ve been discussing śūnyatā from a metaphysical perspective and
exploring how it relates to physics. But śūnyatā is ultimately an
insight into the nature of the mind—this very reality that we are in
direct contact with. As such, it is something that can be <em>directly
known</em>, but only via a direct perception of emptiness, and that only
occurs when the first bhūmi—the first spiritual attainment of the
bodhisattva path—is realized.</p>
<p>In this sense, I don’t believe that śūnyatā can be known without some
kind of <em>revelation</em>. Not a <em>divine revelation</em>, mind you,
which we’ve agreed is inadequate because we wouldn’t know whether the
divinity was malevolent or mistaken. In a way, there is divine
revelation here—the Buddha is omniscient—but the difference is that
we can confirm śūnyatā with direct perception.</p>
<p>If emptiness seems difficult to pin down, you’re in good company—I
don’t think the idea can ever be fully grasped without realization.
After all, its realization demarcates bodhisattvas from ordinary beings.
Given this, I think that it would be prudent to give the idea space to
evolve and to withhold judgment. There is a Zen metaphor about this,
which I’ll read:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Nan-in, a Japanese master during the Meiji era, received a university
professor who came to inquire about Zen.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Not that your tea cup is full, but it can be helpful to have this in
mind when approaching a new set of ideas. And, of course, it is
perfectly valid to go back and compare or critique after having first
considered the new ideas on their own terms.</p>
<p>Dijon:: My cup is partially filled with a physicalist world view, but
I will try to empty it. I’ve often pondered how consciousness could
arise from matter. Despite this, I’ve always viewed the mind, our brain,
and our senses as a small object in a vast external world. I’ve never
seriously considered whether the mind could be primary and the external
world secondary.</p>
<p>If the mind were primary, then I could imagine how one could know
that nothing has svabhāva, even if this weren’t apparent in the laws of
physics.</p>
<p>I have to go, but perhaps when we resume our conversation, we can
explore why you think the mind is primary?</p>
<p>Eurus:: That sounds good. I look forward to it. If you have time,
pick up a translation of the <em>Mūlamadhyamakakārikā</em>.</p>
<p>Dijon:: I’ll do that! Good night!</p>
