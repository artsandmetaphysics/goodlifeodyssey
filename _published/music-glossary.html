<p>One of life’s joys is listening to music. To appreciate music it’s
helpful to know some musical terms. I’ve found that being aware of these
terms help me notice and appreciate the music I listen to.</p>
<p>A melody is <em>conjunct</em> if it tends to progress along adjacent
notes in the scale. I.e., there are only small, smooth jumps. A melody
is <em>disjunct</em> if it tends to progress with big jumps. The terms
are usually relative.</p>
<p><em>Plainchant</em>, often referred to as <em>Gregorian chant</em>,
is unadorned and monophonic chanting.</p>
<p><em>Polyphony</em> is a musical texture in which two or more
principal melodies are heard simultaneously.</p>
<p><em>Organum</em> was the earliest composed and notated polyphony.
Organum<br />
presents a plainchant in one voice, while another voice decorates
and<br />
embellishes the plainchant.</p>
<p><em>Melisma</em> is a group of notes sung to one syllable of
text.</p>
<p>A <em>madrigal</em> is a part-song for several voices, especially one
of the Renaissance period, typically arranged in elaborate counterpoint
and without instrumental accompaniment.</p>
<p>A <em>note</em> is a notated pitch with duration.</p>
<p>A <em>melody</em> is a succession of notes.</p>
<p>A <em>motif</em> is a brief succession of notes that is sequenced,
repeated, and transformed to produce a melody.</p>
<p>A <em>tune</em> is a generally singable melody with a clear sense of
beginning, middle, and end.</p>
<p>The <em>theme</em> is the principle “musical idea” in a given section
of music.</p>
<p><em>Texture</em> refers to the number of melodies present and the
relationship between or among those melodies in a given section of
music.</p>
<p><em>Monophony</em> consists of a single unaccompanied melody
line.</p>
<p><em>Polyphony</em>, or <em>counterpoint</em>, consists of two or more
simultaneous melody lines of equal importance. Imitative polyphony is
characterized by overlapping more or less the same melody line in
multiple parts. The imitation can be strict (e.g., a canon or round) or,
as is mostly the case, non-strict. Non-imitative polyphony is
characterized by two or more different melodies of equal importance
heard simultaneously.</p>
<p><em>Homophony</em> texture has one predominant melody line, and all
other melodic material is heard as secondary or accompaniment to the
main melody.</p>
