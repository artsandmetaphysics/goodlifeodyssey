## The Author

I live in New York City with my wife and daughter, and I run a medical software development company.

I enjoy reading, thinking, and writing. I'm especially interested in how to live the good life and how to know what the good life is.

I write anonymously, due to the sensitive nature of the topic.

## This Site

The essays represent my current thoughts on a topic and are revised with my view.

The dialogues are meant to to represents and reflect on both sides of a debate. Often my dialogues are loosely inspired by real discussions. I revise them as I learn new arguments.

The meditations are short pieces, that reflect my thoughts and questions at a particular point in time. I only rarely edit these once written.

The notes and commentary are likely less interesting to a general audience; they contain many quotations and my summaries on various works---mostly classics. I worry that the number and length of the quotations I included extends beyond what is allowable by fair use; as best I can tell, they do not, but I sincerely hope not to cause harm to any of the translators, authors, or publishers I quote.

I hope that the occasional visitor will contact me and share new ideas with me. To facilitate staying in touch with readers, I set up an email list.
