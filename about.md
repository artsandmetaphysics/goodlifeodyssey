## The Author

I live in New York City with my wife and daughter, and I run a medical software development company.

I enjoy reading, thinking, and writing. I'm especially interested in how to live the good life and how to know what the good life is.

I write anonymously, due to the sensitive nature of the topic.

## This Site

The essays represent my current thoughts on a topic and are revised with my view.

I write dialogues to represents and reflect on both sides of a debate. It also lets you argue and rebut without commitment. Often my dialogues are loosely inspired by real discussions.

The meditations are short pieces, that reflect my thoughts and questions on a given day. I only rarely edit these once written, and I provide the date when they were primarily written.

The notes and commentary are likely less interesting to a general audience; they contain many quotations and my summaries on various works---mostly classics. I worry that the number and length of the quotations I included extends beyond what is allowable by fair use; as best I can tell, they do not, but I sincerely hope not to cause harm to any of the translators, authors, or publishers I quote.

I hope that the occasional visitor will contact me and perhaps give me new ideas. The purpose of the email list is to try and stay in touch with visitors who are interested in the content, to facilitate this.
