<h2>The Author</h2>
<p>I live in New York City with my wife and daughter. I’m a biomedical engineer, a software developer, and now a run a successful <a href="https://innolitis.com">medical software development company</a> with an old friend and business partner.</p>
<p>I enjoy reading, thinking, and writing about classic literature, philosophy, history, and religion. I see these activities as ends in and of themselves, however, I'm especially interested in how to apply their wisdom as a means to living the good life. For this reason, I sometimes discuss my business and family. </p>
<p>All opinions are my own.</p>

<h2>This Site</h2>
<p>The essays represent my current thoughts on a topic and are revised with my view.</p>
<p>The dialogues are meant to to represents and reflect on both sides of a debate. Often my dialogues are loosely inspired by real discussions. I revise them as I learn new arguments.</p>
<p>The meditations are short pieces, that reflect my thoughts and questions at a particular point in time. I only rarely edit these once written.</p>
<p>The notes and commentary are likely less interesting to a general audience; they contain many quotations and my summaries on various works—mostly classics. I worry that the number and length of the quotations I included extends beyond what is allowable by fair use; as best I can tell, they do not, but I sincerely hope not to cause harm to any of the translators, authors, or publishers I quote.</p>
<p>I hope that the occasional visitor will contact me and share new ideas with me. To facilitate staying in touch with readers, I set up an email list.</p>
